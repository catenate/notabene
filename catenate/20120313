Poster suggested one grandiose program to typeset text, perform
mathematics, pivot tables, project slides, and generally be the One
True Document Editor for any page-oriented purpose.

I humbly submit that such an environment was in fact available before
the advent of the WYSIWYG editor.  In the UNIX text editing system,
all data is in ASCII (later UTF-8 in Plan 9), and the writer has at
hand a wide variety of customizable tools, to slice and dice the data
or text, and to then recombine them, in any way conceivable, without
relying on which features a GUI programmer saw fit to make available
via drop-down menus.

This text editing system also supports the generation of (La)TeX
documents, so far the best (maturity and depth) and most widely
available (free for Windows, Linux, MacOS) tool for typesetting
mathematics and integrating graphics with technical papers.  Evidence
of its utility may be found in its widespread use by academia for
publishing papers.

The UNIX text editing system, and (La)TeX, uses encoded source to
generate documents, instead of trying (usually poorly) to both display
the final document and support editing at once.  The advantage of this
approach—text-based encoding with separate generation and presentation
steps—becomes apparent when one must make widespread structural
changes which the GUI tool does not support, or other transformations
of the text which may be automated in text form, but usually aren't in
commercial tools since they're too rare for publishing houses to
justify including and debugging.

A layout which properly emphasizes keywords in the Surgeon General's warning.
I don't think I'll see this behind the counter any time soon.¹
