great so far—API allows your build system / deployments etc.  to

nb redo web dependency example

djb redo¹ is a software build system designed to be a replacement for make.
The goal of these ‘redo by example’ posts are to show the power of redo,
mainly through evidence instead of me talking about it.  The goal of this
example is to track a list of urls via the ‘Last- Modified’ HTTP header.
When the ‘Last-Modified’ header changes, we redownload the file.  I wrote
this build script to keep track of a list of .mobi ebooks that occasionally
get updated.  You can imagine using this technique to download updated
library packages or something similar.

nb gofast scons perform gmake parallel clean increment build time swap memory disk
Melski, E.  20100811.  The last word on SCons performance.  Electric Cloud: Blog.
http://www.electric-cloud.com/blog/2010/08/11/the-last-word-on-scons-performance/

It’s definitely better than vanilla SCons, but still nowhere near as
fast as gmake.  … To my amazement, SCons with GoFast settings actually
beats gmake on clean builds.  My guess is that this is probably
because SCons handles file deletion in-process, while gmake must
invoke a separate process (rm).
