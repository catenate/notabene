filter(function, sequence) returns a sequence consisting of those
items from the sequence for which function(item) is true.

map(function, sequence) calls function(item) for each of the
sequenceâ€™s items and returns a list of the return values.

reduce(function, sequence) returns a single value constructed by
calling the binary function function on the first two items of the
sequence, then on the result and the next item, and so on.
