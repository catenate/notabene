nb clang preprocessor include header file depend analysis @rvcx
C-style include files are the canonical example of dependency analysis.
Any build system that has to treat them as a special case is broken.

nb harvard classic book list project gutenberg
http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Harvard_Classics_(Bookshelf)

The Harvard Classics, originally known as Dr. Eliot's Five Foot Shelf,
is a 51-volume anthology of classic works from world literature,
compiled and edited by Harvard University president Charles W. Eliot,
that was first published in 1909.  Dr. Eliot, then President of
Harvard University, had stated in speeches that the elements of a
liberal education could be obtained by spending 15 minutes a day
reading from a collection of books that could fit on a five-foot shelf.
(Originally he had said a three-foot shelf.)

Free, open source software loses tons of prospective contributors
because it is difficult to learn how and where you can fit in.
OpenHatch is an open source community aiming to help newcomers find
their way into free software projects.  We work toward this goal
through this website and in-person outreach events.

nb phase change memory pcm ibm reliable solid state store
Sakr, S.  20110630.  IBM develops 'instantaneous' memory,
100x faster than flash.  Engadget: Science, storage.
http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/30/embargo-ibm-develops-instantaneous-memory-100x-faster-than-fl/

A new kind of phase change memory (PCM) that reads and writes 100
times faster than flash, stays reliable for millions of write-cycles
(as opposed to just thousands with flash), and is cheap enough to be
used in anything from enterprise-level servers all the way down to
mobile phones.  PCM is based on a special alloy that can be nudged
into different physical states, or phases, by controlled bursts of
electricity.  … Not only is their latest variant more reliable, it can
also store four data bits per cell.
