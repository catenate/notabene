We're in Mountain View, CA. All the standard terms apply (VC funded,
competitive salary and equity, mission to change the world, etc., etc.)
There are three key differences: We invent hardcore technology to
allow people to disrupt stagnant industries.  We don't touch, nor care
for stagnant industries ourselves.  When people look at our latest
product, they're blown away by what it can do.  Even our administrative
hires understand NHST in depth and kick the CEO's butt in chess.

How many surrealists does it take to change a light bulb?
Two, one to hold the giraffe, and the other to fill  the bathtub
with brightly colored machine tools. 

Surrealist jokes just aren't my cup of fur.
