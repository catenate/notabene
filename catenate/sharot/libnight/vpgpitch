(2)  Sharot: A nightmare in the library.  Pronounce sharot to rhyme
with tarot.  The title is meant to invoke two key features of the game
(shared play areas, and tarot cards), and be a new name not on already
on boardgamegeek.com.  The subtitle refers to the flavor of this
instance of the game: you need to free yourself of the forbidden
knowledge eating your brain.

(3a)  At least 24 tarot- or poker-sized cards, to display point value,
effect text, card name, and possibly variant-tarot art.

(3b)  Turn Type: Turn based, minced sequence of play.  Player Mode:
2–4 players with a shared area between players (playtested), 5–8
players with one shared area (not yet playtested).  Only play tested
face-to-face.  Category: Abstract, Horror/Survivor.

Write major arcana instead of tarot, so people understand it's not the
whole set.

(3c)  Epoch: Alternate history (Lovecraftian 1920s).  Scope: One night
in the life.  Tactical scale.  Overhead perspective of what currently
“eats at” each player.

and another, or only you, to reduce the influence of cosmic horrors and
save your sanity.

(6)  You and your clever friends hid away overnight in the restricted

cards that manipulate cards affecting you and another, or only you,
to reduce the influence of cosmic horrors and save your sanity.
