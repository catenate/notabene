Tarot-sized cards could display the point value (important for reading
the board), play text (important for knowing what to do), and art
(not important to gameplay).  The first thing I would omit from
poker-sized cards, if necessary, would be art.  Each card currently
has no more effect text than fits on half a business card, written
with a fine-point sharpie.
