Competitive as it stands, but there could be a coöperative game lurking
in there somewhere, with some rules about how the remainder of the
deck not held by players should play itself.

Since there is hidden information (the cards in players’ hands), and
cards go in and out of players’ hands during the game, I’m not sure
how well that would translate to remote play.
