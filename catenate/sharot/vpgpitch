(2)  Lacking a better name, I currently call it “Sharot”, pronounced to
rhyme with tarot.  This name is meant to invoke two key features of
the game (shared play areas, and tarot cards), and be a new name not
on already on boardgamegeek.com.

(3a)  At least 24 tarot- or poker-sized cards, to display point value,
effect text, card name, and possibly variant-tarot art.

(3b) Turn Type: Turn based, minced sequence of play.  Player Mode:
2–4 players with a shared area between players (playtested), 5–8
players with one shared area (not yet playtested).  Only play tested
face-to-face.  Category: Abstract, Fighting, Horror/Survivor.
