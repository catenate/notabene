Play Sharot cards to minimize points on your side and points shared
with each other player.  Follow the order in which effects are listed
on cards, since it makes a difference.  Cards which affect only one
card may affect one card in a stack, limited by the effects of Pillar
and Sisyphus.  In general, cards may join a stack with Pillar or
Sisyphus.

"Fugitive.  x0 This card stack has no point sum.  XXIIII This card alone."
When played as part of a card stack, multiply the point sum of the
card stack by zero.  When played alone, on any side or share,
its point value is 24.  This means that it can’t be combined with any
other cards and keep its value of 24.

"Magus I.  Play this card in place of another.  Replay that card."
A player may play Magus to replay other cards, and then use
other cards to replay Magus, et cetera, only so long as it makes
a difference in the card layout.

"Misery II. Move one card from one side to another.  Play in its
place."

"Father III.  Play on a side.  Share one card from that side."
Move a card from a side into one of the side’s shares.  Father may
share, because it plays before a card moves.

"Lovers =IIII.  Share between two players.  They share points of their
side cards."  Their side cards are not moved to the shared area,
so any card which moves away Lovers cancels the point sharing.

"Mercy V.  Immediately play under a just-played card.  Cancel its
effects, not its points."  Mercy cancels all the effects of any card.
This includes the effects of cards which change point sums,
so such cards are worth just their face point value.

"Constancy VI.  Play on a share.  Move one card to another share."
Constancy may share, because it plays before a card moves.

"Mother VII.  Play on a share.  Move one card from that share to
its side." A card moves from a share to one of the sides it separates.

"Trebuchet VIII.  Play in any share.  Move a card stack from one of
its sides to the other."  Play the Trebuchet to the share between the
source and destination sides.

"Stranger VIIII.  In hand: your turn is next.  Each turn starts by moving
this card to share or side with fewest points." The player dealt this
card plays it as the first play of the game.  At the beginning of each turn,
the card alone moves to the share or side with fewest points.  If more
than one share or side has the same number of fewest points, then the
current player decides where to move the card.

"Adjustment X.  Move highest-point card stack to side with fewest points.
Play in its place." Adjustment is never the highest-point card stack,
because it does not play to a side until after the stack moves.

"Fortune XI.  Play on your side.  Each player passes a card
stack clockwise." Fortune may move, because it plays before the
stacks move.

"Fortitude 3xXII.  Triple the point sum of this card stack."
Sum the values of all the cards in the stack, then multiply.
Fortitude adds at least 36 points to the card stack it joins.

"Traitor -XIII.  Negate the point sum of this card stack."
Multiply the point sum of the card stack by -1.

"Temperance XIIII.  Play on a side.  Move a card stack from that side
to each of its shares."  Share only as many card stacks as there are
other players.  Temperance may share, because it plays before
stacks move.

"Death XV.  Remove a card from play.  Play in its place."
This card affects Pillar and Sisyphus, and other cards in their stacks.
Death removes the card entirely from play, so its effects and points
no longer affect the game.

"Devil XVI.  Move a card stack to each other side from a side.
Play on that side." Move only as many card stacks as there are
other players.  Devil does not move, because it does not play
until after stacks move.

"Severity XVII.  Immediately play under a just-played card.
Each other player clockwise replays that card." A replayed card
added to a stack with Pillar stops replaying.  A player may play
Severity to replay other cards, and then use other cards to replay
Severity, et cetera, only so long as it makes a difference in the
card layout.

"Pillar XVIII.  This card stack does not move or replay or share."
Pillar and other cards in its stack may not be moved, passed,
picked up, replaced, replayed, shared, et cetera, from a stack
containing Pillar.  All such cards may die, or have their effects
cancelled by Mercy as they are added to a stack containing Pillar.

"Moon XVIIII.  Shuffle and deal a share’s cards to players’ hands.
Play on that share." Pick up all cards on the share.  Play Moon after
you deal all the other cards, so do not shuffle or deal Moon.

"Star 2xXX.  Double the point sum of this card stack."
Sum the values of all the cards in the stack, then multiply.
Fortitude adds at least 40 points to the card stack it joins.

"Sun XXI.  Shuffle and deal a side’s cards to players’ hands.
Play on that side." Pick up all cards on the side.  Play Sun after you
distribute all the other cards.  A player may play Sun to replay other
cards, and then use other cards to replay Sun, et cetera, only so long
as it makes a difference in the card layout.

"Judgement XXII.  Play to a share.  The share’s players switch hand
and position."  The simplest way to do this is to have the two players
put face down their hand of cards on each side, then get up and
sit in each other’s seats.

"Sisyphus XXIII.  Replay all cards from a side.  Play this card on
that side.  It does not move or replay." Play Sisyphus after you
replay all the other cards, so none of the replayed cards are played
on Sisyphus.  While the cards are replayed, the Sisyphus card is
effectively hidden.  Other cards may be moved or replayed from a
stack containing Sisyphus.
	In general, do not move, replace, replay, or share Sisyphus.
Any other cards in Sisyphus’ stack may be affected by a card,
which would separate Sisyphus from a card in his stack, or the
remainder of his stack.

Cards grouped by function.  Fugitive, Lovers, Fortitude, Traitor, and
Star change point sums.  Magus, Misery, Father, Mercy, Constancy,
Mother, Stranger, Death, and Severity (re)move, replay, or unplay one
card.  Moon, Sun, and Sisyphus distribute or replay card stacks.
Trebuchet, Adjustment, Fortune, Temperance, Devil, and Pillar (don’t)
move card stacks.  Judgement changes player sides.
