But allowing that mankind hath the rule of right within himself, yet it
may be asked, â€˜What obligations are we under to attend to and follow it?'
I answer: it has been proved that man by his nature is a law to himself,
without the particular distinct consideration of the positive sanctions of
that law; the rewards and punishments which we feel, and those which from
the light of reason we have ground to believe, are annexed to it.
The question then carries its own answer along with it.  Your obligation to
obey this law, is its being the law of your nature.  That your conscience
approves of and attests to such a course of action, is itself alone an
obligation.  Conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we
should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it, that it
is our natural guide, the guide assigned us by the Author of our nature;
it therefore belongs to our condition of being, it is our duty to walk in
our path, and follow this guide without looking about to see whether we may
not possibly forsake them with impunity.


nb jratzinger pope benedict conscience
Ratzinger, J. 1968.  Herbert Vorgrimler's Commentary on the documents of
Vatican II: 139.  London.

Over the Pope as the expression of the binding claim of ecclesiastical
authority there still stands one's own conscience, which must be
obeyed before all else, if necessary even against the requirement of
ecclesiastical authority.
