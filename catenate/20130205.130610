Find out how modern electronic markets work, why stock prices change in
the ways they do, and how computation can help our understanding of them.
Build algorithms and visualizations to inform investing practice.

Build a working stock market simulator that you can use to test
investing strategies.

The course is intended for people with software programming experience
and introductory level knowledge of investment practice.  The primary
prerequisite is an excitement about the stock market.

If you already use advanced software tools such as Mean Variance
Optimizers in your regular investing practice, you will probably find
that you are “overqualified” for this course.

If you would like to receive a certificate of completion, you will
have to turn in several programming projects using the Python
programming language.  You should have Python experience, and Unix and
Python software installation experience (i.e., PyPI, apt-get, easy install).
You should have a genuine interest in the stock market and an
understanding of basic statistical principles such as probability
distributions.
