nb leviticus 25:10 liberty bell release enslaved jobel yobel yovel yovlim jubilee rashi jehuda ibn ezra ram horn sofar trumpet

Sefaria: and you shall hallow the fiftieth year.  You shall proclaim
release throughout the land for all its inhabitants.  It shall be a
jubilee for you: each of you shall return to his holding and each of
you shall return to his family.

Rashi: R. [JY]ehuda said, “What is the etymology of the term רורד,
freedom?  A free man is like a person who may dwell (רוד) at an inn—
meaning that he may reside in any place he pleases, and is not under
the control of others.”  רורד therefore implies liberty of residence.ⁱ
  ⁱ Rosh Hashanah 9b

Ibn Ezra: freedom: This word means “liberty”.  Compare,
“like a flying swallow”.⁲  The term there denotes a bird which
sings as long as it is free; but if it is forced into captivity,
it will starve itself to death.
  ⁲ nb proverbs 26:2

Ibn Ezra: jubilee [Hebrew: yovel] This word means “release”.  Our Sages,
of blessed memory, have told us⁳ that the word originally denoted a
male lamb (as in, “trumpets of ram’s horns [Hebrew: yovlim]”⁴).
The year was named after the horns that announce it.
  ⁳ Rosh HaShana 26a

רֹו֛רְּד: (n-m) a flowing, free run, liberty; flowing (of myrrh); liberty.⁶

רֹורְּד: (n-f) a swallow, bird.⁶

Siftei Chakhamim: The fields return.  According to this, the verse is
in the wrong order.  It should say, “The ancestral land should return
to each man,” and not that the owners return to the fields as is
implied in “Each man shall return, etc.”

Talmud: The verse states: “And you shall proclaim liberty [deror]
throughout all the land to all its inhabitants,” and immediately
afterward it says: “It shall be a Jubilee for you.”
  ⁵ nb rosh hashanah 9b:7 

JPS: Others “liberty”.

JPS: Heb. yobel, “ram” or “ram’s horn.”

In Torah this week we read B’har/B’chukotai, a double portion that
brings us to the end of Leviticus.  In B’har, we find the famous
verse, “You shall proclaim release throughout the land for all its
inhabitants” (Leviticus 25:10).  Inscribed on the Liberty Bell with
the word “freedom” instead of “release,” it, nevertheless, connotes
the expectation that humanity thrives in places where freedom from
hunger, redemption from bondage of any form, and release from
tribulations unleash our greatest human potential.  Freedom from toil
reflected in the weekly Sabbath and cyclical Jubilee year, were chief
among the commandments that the Israelites would observe in order to
know God’s greatest blessings.⁷
