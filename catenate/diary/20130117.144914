nb ccache decompress space speed analysis hit miss maximum size overflow compile time algorithm
Should we consider CCACHE_COMPRESS?  All c->o productions will go
slower by using compression.  Each object file stored in the cache
will take up less space.  This space could be claimed from the cache,
or used to store more objects, which means more potential cache hits,
if people are getting cache misses for objects once stored in the cache.
More hits means that the build will go faster, by an amount equal to
the time saved from compiling the extra reused objects (if any),
minus the time it takes to decompress those objects.
