Targum Jonathan: This heretic said to him: How do you know this?
Rav Sheshet said to him: Royalty on earth is like royalty in the heavens,
as it is written with regard to God’s revelation to Elijah the Prophet
on Mount Horeb:
	“And He said: Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord.
And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord;
but the Lord was not in the wind;
and after the wind an earthquake;
but the Lord was not in the earthquake;
and after the earthquake a fire;
but the Lord was not in the fire;
and after the fire a still small voice.
And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his
mantle and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave”.⁳
	God’s revelation was specifically at the moment of silence.⁲
  ⁲ Talmud Berakhot 58a:11
  ⁳ I Kings 19:11–13

Ein Yaakov: After the earthquake there was a fire, but the Lord was not
in the fire; after the fire there, was heard the sound of a soft whisper.⁴
  ⁴ Midrash Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Berakhot 9:8 (Fol. 58a)

Midrash Tanchuma: After the earthquake comes fire, and after death
comes the judgment of the netherworld, which is composed of fire.
Following the fire there is a still, small voice, and after the judgment
of the netherworld there is this great day of judgment, as is said.⁵
  ⁵ Midrash Tanchuma, Pekudei 3:14

Conscience speaks not with the thunder of an earthquake, nor with the
consuming blaze of fire, but with the whisper of a still, small voice,
nearly silent, for those who will listen.
