nb efficient little language environment simple tool affordance script dictionary run button output pane applescript rename artist itunes
DeNigris, S.  20110425.  Love poor technology for simple tasks.

For example, I wanted to change the artist info of a batch of tracks
in iTunes.  In less?  time than it would have taken me to google a
solution, I had whipped up an AppleScript¹ (yes, ouch) in AppleScript
Editor (double ouch).  Yes, I could have used rb-appscript to script
from Ruby, which I usually do.  But, AE gave me easy access to iTunes’
scripting dictionary, a nice little “Run” button, and an output pane.
 ¹ 	tell application "iTunes"
		set wrongName to ""
		set rightName to ""
		set track_list to tracks of playlist "Music" of source "Library" whose artist is wrongName
		repeat with t in track_list
			set artist of t to rightName
		end repeat
	end tell

Finally, acknowledgment must be given to everybody who has contributed
to the design or construction of a build tool.  Most software projects
use some type of build tool, making the build system a critical piece
of technology.  The people who create these tools don’t always get the
credit they deserve.
