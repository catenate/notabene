nb rubber compile latex build system bibtex dvips postscript pdf
Kishimoto, P.  20091123.  Rubberâ€”a wrapper for LaTeX and friends.
Launchpad.
https://launchpad.net/rubber

Rubber is a program whose purpose is to handle all tasks related to
the compilation of LaTeX documents.  This includes compiling the
document itself, of course, enough times so that all references are
defined, and running BibTeX to manage bibliographic references.
Automatic execution of dvips to produce PostScript documents is also
included, as well as usage of pdfLaTeX to produce PDF documents.
