** Point-by-point review of all sides.

* My own Jewish family.

Ian, as my son.

Angela, as my girlfriend, fiancée, and wife.

Morgan, as my daughter-in-law.

* Models of non-supernatural Jewish identity.

Richard Feynman.

Sam Harris.

Stephen Pinker.

Belief in Sky-Daddy or an afterlife not required.

* Tradition of democratic liberal thought.

Non-dogmatic (except orthodoxy).

Influences on America.

Rights of women in marriage (eg ketubah, get).

Home as a sanctuary, ordinary people as teachers, meals as a sacrament.

Everyone encouraged to find their own meaning, decide what it means to
them, and transmit that understanding to others.

* Current expressions of hatred towards Jews.

** Arguments from conscience.

* I don’t have to convert, to study the culture and ideas.

* My fate is tied up with Ian and Angela and Morgan in any event.

* I want to participate in a community of people with whom I have
something in common.  However, elements of the community will not
accept me, as a convert, and orthodoxy will never accept me because I
don’t agree with them.

* I want to learn and take into myself the reasons why a community
lasted for 4500 years.

* I want to participate in the literary tradition.

* I want to support Angela’s (and Morgan’s) practice of Judaism,
and create a Jewish home with Angela.

* I can support Angela and Morgan without becoming Jewish myself.

* A lot of people irrationally hate Jews, so I would become (in ways I
am not now, and likely will never otherwise experience) a member of a
minority group which receives physical threats and verbal abuse, and
it mould be on me to help respond to this and protect them.

* I want to better the world, in a community of people who want the
same, and support those who do.

* You won’t be able to assume I agree with you, for either good or bad
reasons.

** Call to action.
