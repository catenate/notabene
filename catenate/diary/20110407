nb plan9 bin ape sh pdksh 
yarikos@gmail.com: finally, there are /bin/ape/sh which is a pdksh
with its "features".

comeau@panix.com: And in our opinion it is nicely done in terms of
supporting ksh'y things (at least it's taken some large and "wacked
out stuff" we've thrown at it like a champ), but I'll guess probably
one needs to look also at its footprint vs (or in addition to) rsh's,
if this read issue and similar is of such concern to OP.
