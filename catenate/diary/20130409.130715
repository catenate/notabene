Norvig, P.  Teach yourself programming in ten years.  Peter@Norvig.com.
web 'http://norvig.com/21-days.html?'

The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again,
but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current
ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it,
and correcting any mistakes.  Then repeat.  And repeat again.
