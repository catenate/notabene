nb greek tragedy people nature cause event

The essence of Greek tragedy is that it’s not like a traffic accident
where somebody dies.  In the Greek sense, tragedy is where something
happens because it has to happen because of the nature of the
participants.  Because the people involved make it happen and they
have no choice but to make it happen because that’s their nature.
