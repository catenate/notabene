nb jeremiah 17:10 individual merit justice even handed no uproot destroy sow reap way fruit deed קר reyk empty content conscience heart remind repay action result

Sefaria: I the LORD probe the heart, Search the mind—
To repay every man according to his ways,
With the proper fruit of his deeds.

Conscience stabs the heart, and scans the mind—
To remind every one what ey did,
and the actual results of eir deeds.

As ye sow, so shall ye reap.

Shney Luchot HaBrit:ⁱ It is not the function of Justice to uproot or to
destroy, rather it is the function of Justice to treat each person on
his merits.  The very letters of the name הקבר reflect this even-
handedness of the attribute of Justice.  The two letters קר⁳ allude to
a person who is Reyk, empty of merits, whereas the two letters הב⁴
allude to someone who has content.  Together this is what Justice is
all about.  G'd pays man ויללעמ ירפכ וכרדכ, "according to his way
with the fruit of his deeds”.⁲
