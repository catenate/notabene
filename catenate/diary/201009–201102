nb acmesac acme translate language
Nichols, E. and Matsumoto, Y. -2007.  Acme as an interactive
translation environment: Acme for poets.  Nara institute of science
and technology: Computational linguistics laboratory.
http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/IWP9/2007/20.acme-trans.pdf

The Acme text editor and programming environment makes it worth
reconsidering plain text as an interface.  In Acme the mouse is used
to provide a consistent semantics for treating text as commands.
This echoes the lack of distinction between a program and data that is
common in functional programming languages like Lisp and Scheme.
In terms of user interfaces, this frees the users from having to
remember obscure shortcuts or navigate complicated menus to access
their tools; all they need to do is type the name of the command.
This reduces the burden on the user’s memory and makes it much simpler
to carry out the desired action: simply click on the text of a command
to execute it.  Acme takes care of interpreting the text as a command
by sending a request to the shell where the requested command is
executed and the output is displayed in a new buffer.  An example of
Acme in action is given in Figure 1.

This design has some interesting implications.  Because any text can
be executed as a command, the user is not limited in terms of what
tools he or she can access, keeping the workflow dynamic and allowing
it to easily adapt to the needs of a given task.  At the same time,
the clear division in roles—the keyboard for text production, and the
mouse for text interpretation–as well as the clean semantics of the
mouse buttons for select/execute/get provides consistency to the UI.
By providing an easy way for text to be interpreted as commands,
Acme combines the command and its interface, removing the disconnect
between what the user wants to do and how it is done.  This makes the
UI easier to figure out and remember, and produces an interface that
is more suitable for text-based tasks.

Acme makes applying tools to data as easy as clicking on text with a mouse.
Furthermore, the small tools design philosophy that inspired Acme
makes it easy to apply existing NLP tools in Acme.  This means that
tasks like using reference materials or editing text are easy.
Users who frequently deal with language, such as linguists,
translators, language learners, or poets need to be able to
efficiently explore and manipulate language.  Acme can provide a
powerful working environment for users who spend a lot of time
interacting with text.

Acme is clearly attractive for text-heavy tasks like translation,
however, some work needs to be done to produce a usable environment.
Tools and intuitive interfaces need to be constructed for common text
manipulation tasks such as splitting a sentence into words or phrases,
looking up words in dictionaries, or translating phrases using
translation memories or machine translation systems.  Support for
multi-lingual input needs to be improved: we need redistributable
fonts with good Unicode coverage and good input method editors for
handling input and display of text in languages that do not use
Latin-based scripts.  Finally, we need a way of getting Acme to the
end user in a simple, easy to install package that works out-of-box.

nb agile loyal business partner customer perspective requirement story release schedule industry pace product feature support
Morgan, L.  20101015.  Customer confidence hinges on agile schedules.
Software development times.
http://www.sdtimes.com/content/SDTimesPDFEdition.aspx?File=sdtimes256.pdf

… One of the things that struck me as the principal analyst was how
obvious agile development practices are becoming to the average
business consumer.  Most of these non-technical observers talk about
agile development in terms of its effect.  They’re noticing that some
platform providers are rolling out releases every two weeks while
others are rolling out releases maybe once or twice per year.  The
paid search platform providers who have adopted agile development
practices are seen as more in tune with customer requirements and also
more in tune with Google’s constant modifications to its algorithms.
The difference in release schedules is affecting software provider
preferences and, ultimately, sales.  Agile development is also
affecting customer loyalty.  No one wants to be aligned with a
dinosaur, particularly when the part of the industry you’re working in
is moving at light speed.  Customer loyalty also plays out in terms of
customer requirements.  Since the dawn of software, users have always
had something to say about how it could be improved.  The difference
is, more agile tools and platforms are allowing companies to more
easily adopt and prioritize customer requests if not transform them
into stories.  Some of the marketers interviewed for the report were
flattered and impressed that their platform vendors were actively
listening to them, and even more impressed when the vendor had morphed
one or more of their requests into product features.  For the less
egotistical, the new features were the sign of a good and dedicated
business partner.  … Finally, agile development practices are being
viewed as a form of customer support, particularly as it relates to
product features.  … The human element above all things shapes the
lifetime value of customer relationships, at least among the people
interviewed for the report.  Features are nice, price is nice, but in
the end, if you don’t have a partner you can rely on, the rest doesn’t
matter all that much.

nb build ninja martine github manual
https://github.com/martine/ninja
http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html

Build systems get slow when they need to make decisions.  When you are
in a edit-compile cycle you want it to be as fast as possible—you want
the build system to do the minimum work necessary to figure out what
needs to be built immediately.

Ninja contains the barest functionality necessary to describe
arbitrary dependency graphs.  Its lack of syntax makes it impossible
to express complex decisions.  Instead, Ninja is intended to be used
with a separate program generating its input files.  The generator
program (like the ./configure found in autotools projects) can analyze
system dependencies and make as many decisions as possible up front so
that incremental builds stay fast.  Going beyond autotools, even
build-time decisions like "which compiler flags should I use?" or
"should a build a debug or release-mode binary?" belong in the
ninjafile generator.

The -t flag on the Ninja command line runs some tools that I have
found useful during Ninja’s development.  The current tools are:
	query: dump the inputs and outputs of a given target.
	browse: browse the dependency graph in a web browser.
Clicking a file focuses the view on that file, showing inputs
and outputs.  This feature requires a Python installation.
	graph: output a file in the syntax used by graphviz,
an automatic graph layout tool.  Use it like ¹.  In the Ninja source tree,
“ninja graph” generates an image for Ninja itself.
 ¹ ninja -t graph target | dot -Tpng -ograph.png /dev/stdin

Goetz, B.  Lambda expressions, SAM conversion, method references,
virtual extension methods.  Java community process.
http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/proposalDetails?id=335

We propose extending the Java Language to support compact lambda
expressions (otherwise known as closures or anonymous methods.)
Additionally, we will extend the language to support a conversion
known as "SAM conversion" to allow lambda expressions to be used where
a single-abstract-method interface or class is expected,
enabling forward compatibility of existing libraries.
	We propose extending the semantics of interfaces in the Java
Language to support virtual extension methods, whereby an interface
can nominate a static default method to stand in for the implementation
of an interface method, in the event that an implementation class does not
provide an implementation of the extension method.  This enables
interfaces to be augmented with new methods "after the fact" without
breaking existing implementation classes.
	Time permitting, we will use these features to augment the
core Java SE libraries to support a more lambda-friendly style of
programming, such as ¹ or ².  This will likely be accompanied by a set
of standardized "SAM" types such as Predicate, Filter, Mapper,
Reducer, etc.

inexpensive 2u systems with 8 cores (dual-quads), a boatload of memory
and large, fast disks.  Then we put VMWare’s ESX Server on them, and
started using virtual machines instead of physical for the bulk of our
development and testing needs.  We didn’t realize it at the time, but
we had created a private development cloud.

Godin, S. The inevitable decline due to clutter.  Seth Godin's blog.
http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/12/the-inevitable-decline-from-clutter.html

Digital media expands.  It's not like paper, it can get bigger.
As digital marketers seek to increase profits, they almost always make
the same mistake.  They continue to add more clutter, messaging and offers,
because, hey, it's free.  One more link, one more banner, one more
side deal on the Groupon page.  Economics tells us that the right
thing to do is run the factory until the last item produced is being
sold at marginal cost.  In other words, keep adding until it doesn't
work any more.  In fact, human behavior tells us that this is a more
permanent effect than we realize.  Once you overload the user,
you train them not to pay attention.  More clutter isn’t free.
In fact, more clutter is a permanent shift, a desensitization to /all/
the information, not just the last bit.  And it's hard to go backward.
More is not always better.  In fact, more is almost never better.

Morgan, L.  20101015.  Continuous integration: Not just for agile anymore.
Software development times.
http://www.sdtimes.com/content/SDTimesPDFEdition.aspx?File=sdtimes256.pdf

nb coint practice
Set team expectations.  Because nightly builds require constant
consumption of and contribution to code, developers need to get used
to smaller, faster, more iterative cycles.  Early on, you will likely
notice code-quality improvements.  Later, you will likely discover
that product quality and processes are becoming more predictable and
that you can use metrics to further optimize them.

Get into a rhythm.  “Continuous” can mean literally continuous,
nightly builds, weekly builds, other periodic builds, or a combination
of builds.  Regular, disciplined practices help ensure product and
process consistency.  Without discipline, expect continuous breakage.
Also, make sure your test cases are prioritized so the build can run
within the confines of its cycle frequency.

Run builds as frequently as possible.  That way, developers can get
access to the most recent version of code and reduce the amount of
rework.  You can help speed things up by automating the build process.
Have an infrastructure in place.  Continuous integration is best
achieved using automated tools, build servers (vs.  developers’
desktops), and other infrastructural elements that can help facilitate
its success.

Try preflight builds.  One common gripe about continuous integration
is that it is post facto.  Some tools allow you to test the effect of
changes prior before you officially commit.  (This is particularly
useful for branched code.)

nb coint rework break change
“The longer you hold onto code, the more rework you’re going to have to do.
You want to know that your code is okay and won’t break someone else’s.”
―Mike Rozlog

nb coint justify early team commit
According to [Tom] Grant, team dynamics tend to improve as a result of
continuous integration, especially in organizations with waterfall
practices, because the entire team is committed to changing what
happens early in the software development life cycle.

nb coint rework align change
Without continuous integration, developers sense they’re making
progress but often fear the rework that will be required days, weeks,
or months later when they finally discover how misaligned their
changes are, said [Usman] Muzaffar.

nb coint justify continuous visible self service fail
Central to the notion of “continuous” is automation because it saves
time, speeds processes and lowers costs.  Maciej Zawadzki … said that
although it is possible to automate using a Perl script, to truly
realize the benefits of automation, software teams need two additional
things: visibility, so they can identify problems and fix them; and a
self-service aspect, so they can run scripts themselves even if they
are unable to see someone else’s code.  “It’s not a question of
failure because failures are going to happen,” he said.  “The more
transparent failure is, the easier it is to diagnose what failed.”

nb coint justify frequent build
One Urbancode customer moved from nightly builds to four builds per day so
teams in different regions could see the results.  Other organizations have
taken advantage of nightly cycles to run automated tests, do static
analysis, and execute security scans in addition to builds.

It's better to know right away that a code problem broke the build,

the build so it doesn't break in the first place, or rebuilding the
same patched-up build over and over.  Giving more attention to one

don’t compile.  You can prototype and speculate all you want, but that’s at
best indirect influence on what the rest of a company is doing.  You can’t

are not the person with the power to take it.

Gray, D.  20110208.  The connected company.  Communication nation.
http://communicationnation.blogspot.com/2011/02/connected-company.html

A recent analysis in the CYBEA Journal looked at profit-per-employee
at 475 of the S&P 500, and the results were astounding: As you triple
the number of employees, their productivity drops by half.

Companies are not so much machines as complex, dynamic, growing
systems.  A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found
that as the working population in a given area doubles, productivity
(measured in this case by the rate of invention) goes up by 20%.

Ecosystems: Long-lived companies were decentralized.  They tolerated
“eccentric activities at the margins.” They were very active in
partnerships and joint ventures.  The boundaries of the company were
less clearly delineated, and local groups had more autonomy over their
decisions, than you would expect in the typical global corporation.

Strong identity: Although the organization was loosely controlled,
long-lived companies were connected by a strong, shared culture.
Everyone in the company understood the company’s values.
These companies tended to promote from within in order to keep that
culture strong.  Cities also share this common identity: think of the
difference between a New Yorker and a Los Angelino, or a Parisian, for
example.

Active listening: Long-lived companies had their eyes and ears focused
on the world around them and were constantly seeking opportunities.
Because of their decentralized nature and strong shared culture,
it was easier for them to spot opportunities in the changing world and
act, proactively and decisively, to capitalize on them.

The problem comes with scale.  As the number of employees grows, the
profit per employee shrinks.  It’s a game of diminishing returns.
Efficiencies of scale are balanced out by the burdens of bureaucracy.
Divisions become silos, disconnected from each other.  Overhead costs
increase with size.  The resulting need for control, and the inability
to achieve it at a reasonable cost, is what eventually kills a business.

Understand the culture: A company is like a city in many ways.
First and foremost, a city is about the people who live and work
there; it’s an expression of their collective culture.  Before you can
start your path to the connected company, you need to understand the
culture (or cultures) that are already there, so you can look for ways
to enhance and strengthen that shared identity.

Start small.  Urban designers might look at maps or aerial views as
they make their plans, but the life of a city happens at street level.
As you initiate social programs, think of them as if you are designing
a city street.  A successful street is filled with people.  The last
thing you want is a whole bunch of large, urban areas with no people
in them.  In a city, big, open, empty spaces feel unsafe and unloved.
So start small.  The smaller the space is initially, the faster it
will fill up with people.  A good way to start is with an [small-scope]
organization-wide project or initiative that requires participation
from a number of people across the company.  This gives you a cross-
section of ideas and perspectives to look at as you plan the next stage.

Spaces need owners.  Again, think of the city street: every business
or building has an owner.  The sidewalks have owners—typically every
business at street level “ polices” their stretch of sidewalk.
And even the street has owners—the street sweeper, the cop on the beat.
In the same way, make sure that every online space you create has
someone positioned to take care of it, to keep it safe and clean.

Every person needs a place.  In the same way that public spaces need
caretakers, every person needs a place to live; somewhere they can put
their stuff.  As you build your social business, make sure that every
single person has a place where they can put, and see, their stuff:
their projects, the links they want to get back to, the documents they
create, their role, qualifications, expertise and so on.

Jumping-off points.  A good city street offers opportunities that are
unanticipated but serendipitous.  The promising side-street.  The
sound of music coming through an open door.  As you design for
connection, think about how you might create those unexpected,
but delightful, surprises.  [Like a combination of keywords encourages
tangential thought.]  Every time someone visits an online space,
there’s a chance to offer them something new.

Watch, listen, adjust and adapt.  Design by connection is not a
top-down activity so much as bottom-up.  Complex systems just don’t
work that way.  In a complex system, you need to pay attention to
small things and make little adjustments along the way.  Think about
how city streets evolve: one small step at a time.  One retailer moves
to a larger space; another goes out of business.  One old building is
torn down and replaced; another is rehabbed and turned into lofts.
Pay attention to the culture, and watch how people react to the tools
you provide.  Are they using something in a different way than you
expected?  Find out why and see if you can enhance that.  And what are
they ignoring?  If they’re not using something you expected them to use,
go talk to them and see if you can figure out the reason.

nb compile javascript crankshaft optimize runtime profile google kmillikin fschneider
Millikin, K. and Schneider, F. 20101207.  A new crankshaft for V8.
The chromium blog.
http://blog.chromium.org/2010/12/new-crankshaft-for-v8.html

Crankshaft has four main components: (1) A base compiler which is used
for all code initially.  The base compiler generates code quickly
without heavy optimizations.  Compilation with the base compiler is
twice as fast as with the V8 compiler in Chrome 9 and generates 30%
less code.  (2) A runtime profiler which monitors the running system
and identifies hot code, i.e., code that we spend a significant amount
of the time running.  (3) An optimizing compiler which recompiles and
optimizes hot code identified by the runtime profiler.  It uses static
single assignment form to perform optimizations such as loop-invariant
code motion, linear-scan register allocation and inlining.
The optimization decisions are based on type information collected
while running the code produced by the base compiler.
(4) Deoptimization support which allows the optimizing compiler to be
optimistic in the assumptions it makes when generating code.
With deoptimization support, it is possible to bail out to the code
generated by the base compiler if the assumptions in the optimized
code turn out to be too optimistic.

Heritage has done the grunt work by actually tracking which parts of
the Constitution¹ Congress (Article 1, Section 8) has cited for the
first 450 bills introduced in the House.  The Rules and Regulation
Clause: Sliding into fifth place is Clause 14² with 34 citations.
The Naturalization Clause, Clause 4,³ scrapes ahead of fifth place
with 35 citations.  The Necessary and Proper Clause: Clause 18⁴ flies
into third, boasting more citations then the previous two combined (82).
The Commerce Clause: Clause 3⁵ sweeps into second with 104 citations.
The Spending Clause: Not surprisingly, Clause 1⁶ tops the charts at 134
citations.

http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/12/02/father-raymond-j-desouza-blair-made-it-an-easy-win-for-hitchens/

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger once claimed that the Church had only two
convincing arguments for the truth of the Gospel: the lives of the
saints in her midst and the art which she has inspired.  The good and
the beautiful testify to the truth.  [Good and beautiful are
subjective relational judgements made in comparison with other
experiences in an overall societal framework currently dominated,
in the West, by a religious culture.]


nb faitheist chitchens tblair debate transcript
http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/11/christopher-hitchens-tony-blair

chitchens: Absolutely, I say good luck to it.  The way I phrase it in
my book, available at fine bookstores everywhere, is that I propose a
pact with the faithful, I'll take it again, quoting from the great
Thomas Jefferson, “I don't mind if my neighbour believes in 15 gods or
in none, he neither by that breaks my leg or picks my pocket.”
I would echo that, and say that as long as you don't want your
religion taught to my children in school, given a government subsidy,
imposed on me by violence, any of these things, you are fine by me.
I would prefer not even to know what it is that you do in that church
of yours, in fact, if you force it on my attention, I will consider it
a breach of that pact.  Have your own bloody Christmas, and so on.
Do your slaughtering, if possible, in an abattoir.  And don't mutilate
the genitals of your children!  Because then I'm afraid it gets within
the ambit of law.  All right, don't you think that's reasonably pluralistic
and communitarian of me?  I think it is.  Why is it a vain hope
on my part?  Has this pact ever been honoured by the other side?
Of course not.  It's a mystery to me, and I'll share it with you.
If I believed that there was a saviour who had been appointed or sent,
or a prophet, appointed or sent by a God who bore me in mind,
and loved me, and wanted the best for me, if I believed that, and that
I possessed the means of grace and the hope of glory, to phrase it
like that, I think, I don't know, I think I might be happy.
They say it's the way to happiness.  Why doesn't it make them happy?
Don't you think it's a perfectly decent question?  Because they won't
be happy until you believe it too, because that's what their holy
books tell them.  Now I'm sorry, it's enough with saying in the name
of religion; do these texts say that until every knee bows in the name
of Jesus, there will be no happiness?  Of course it is what they say.
It isn't just a private belief.  It is rather, and I think always has
been, and that's why I'm here, actually a threat to the idea of a
peaceable community, and very often, as now, and frequently, a very
palpable one.  So I think that's the underlying energy that powers the
friendly disagreement between Tony and myself.

…

tblair: I think that the most convincing argument is—and the argument
that people of faith have got to deal with—is actually the argument
Christopher has just made, which is that the bad that is done in the
name of religion is intrinsically grounded in the scripture of religion.
That is the single most difficult argument.

…

chitchens: There is no need to make this a religious thing, the Greeks
had the concept of hubris as something to be avoided and criticised,
but what the Greeks would also have called the apotropaic, the view
that not all the glory can be claimed by primates like ourselves is a
healthy reminder too.  [For example, the power of court of honor was
an emergent effect, and could never have come from committee.]

…

chitchens: I couldn't live without the Parthenon, I don't believe
every civilised person could, if it… much worse than the first temple
had occurred, it seems to me.  And we would have lost an enormous
amount besides by way of our knowledge of symmetry, grace and harmony.
I don't care about the cult of palace Athena, it's gone, and as far as I know…
the sacrifices, some of them human, that were made to those gods, are
regrettable but have been blotted out and forgotten, and Athenian
imperialism is also a thing of the past.  What remains is the
fantastic beauty… the question is how to keep what is of value of this
sort in art in our own emotions… I will go as far as the ecstatic, and
to distinguish it precisely from superstition and the supernatural
which are designed to make us fearful and afraid and servile.

nb gnumake automatic variable target prereq stem
Free software foundation.  20100719.  Automatic variables.  GNU make manual.
http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables

$@: The file name of the target of the rule.  … In a pattern rule that
has multiple targets (see Introduction to Pattern Rules), ‘$@’ is the
name of whichever target caused the rule's recipe to be run.

$<: The name of the first prerequisite.  If the target got its recipe
from an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added by
the implicit rule (see Implicit Rules).

$^: The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.  …
A target has only one prerequisite on each other file it depends on,
no matter how many times each file is listed as a prerequisite.
So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target, the value
of $^ contains just one copy of the name (c.f.  $+).  This list does
not contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for those see the
‘$|’ variable, below.

$*: The stem with which an implicit rule matches (see How Patterns
Match).  If the target is dir/a.foo.b and the target pattern is a.%.b
then the stem is dir/foo.  The stem is useful for constructing names of
related files.  In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file
name that matched the ‘%’ in the target pattern.

If you’re not capturing the result of $(shell) to a variable, you’re probably misusing $(shell).

Features.  Intuitive commands and command aliases.  Support for
familiar HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as HEAD,
OPTIONS and TRACE.  Support for HTTP Secure connections and HTTP Basic
Authentication.  Automatic URL-encoding of userinfo, paths, query-
string parameters, and page fragments.  Transcripts, both verbose and
summary.  Scripting via stdin.  Dead-simple cookie handling and
redirect following.  Built-in help.

The things you can do with htty.  Build a request: you can tweak the
address, headers, cookies, and body at will.  Send the request to the
server: after the request is sent, it remains unchanged in your
session history.  Inspect the server’s response: you can look at the
status, headers, cookies, and body in various ways.  Review history:
a normal and a verbose transcript of your session are available at all
times (destroyed when you quit htty).  Reuse previous requests:
you can refer to prior requests and copy them.

R. Serena Wakefield: Aisle isn't a game per se, but rather a different
means of approaching the idea of fiction.  Rather than present a plot,
it presents an ambiguous situation and gives you a chance to type a
single command.  The command you type determines not only what the
protagonist does, but also who he is.  This is definitely "concept IF,"
but the author has done an excellent job and it's very easy to feel
for the different possible protagonists.  While the level of
interaction is obviously limited in a one-move game, the scenery is
very "deep"; the game seems to have a response for almost everything.

nb lang diversity evolve universal grammar ubykh pirahã mura
Spinney, L. -20101116.  Language erosion: You don't hear that often….
The Independent: Environment.
http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/language-erosion-you-dont-hear-that-often-2134915.html

K David Harrison: “[Koro] contains very sophisticated knowledge that
these people possess about this valley, the ecosystems, the animals,
the plants, how they survived here, how they adapted, so if they
switch over to another language a lot of that knowledge will simply be lost.”

As Mark Pagel, an evolutionary theorist at the University of Reading,
sees it, languages evolve just like organisms, and the ones that
survive are the ones that are best adapted to the human brain and,
hence, easiest to learn.  All humans have the same brain, which is why
successful languages tend to resemble one another, giving the illusion
of a universal grammar.  But, Pagel says, they may have arrived at
that similarity via different routes, and solved the problem of being
easy to learn in different ways.  … If Pagel's prediction is borne
out, then the differences between languages become much more
interesting, because they illuminate the range of strategies the brain
can adopt for learning and making sense of the world.

The researchers taught German and Namibian hunter-gatherer children a
sequence of hand movements relative to the body that followed the
order right, left, right, right.  When they asked them to rotate their
bodies 180 degrees and do it again, the German children reproduced the
same sequence, while the Namibians now produced the sequence left,
right, left, left, indicating their reliance on an allocentric or
absolute frame of reference.

Paul Lewis edits the world's most comprehensive language catalogue, Ethnologue.

AZKent: "One now dead language, Ubykh, had eighty-odd consonants and
one vowel." In contrast Pirahã, a language isolate of the Mura
language family, has one of the smallest phoneme inventories of any
known language.  The pronunciation of several phonemes depends on the
speaker's sex.  Female speakers use seven consonants and three vowels,
while male speakers have one more consonant at their disposal.
Pirahã can be whistled, hummed, or encoded in music.  Consonants and
vowels may be omitted altogether and the meaning conveyed solely
through variations in pitch, stress, and rhythm.  Mothers teach their
children the language through constantly singing the same musical patterns.
There are so many unique features in this language that it probably
counts are the worlds weirdest language.

We restricted ourselves to a single sheet of 8.5"x11" paper and
documented the standards we felt were most important.  Once the page
was filled, we reduced it by eliminating duplicates and highly similar items.
We then sorted it in priority order and cut it to half of a page.
We then studied the list and came up with groupings.  We moved items
into the groups and discussed how it all “felt”.  It took only a
couple of iterations to finalize the list.  The team now has four
signs that hang in their work space.  The three Rs and [a general principle].
Each of the R signs has a short list that further describes what the
team means by the "rule".


nb learn humble white belt apprentice @joelhelbling
Helbling, J.  20100604.  Apprenticeship patterns: The white belt.
JoelHelbling.com.
http://www.joelhelbling.com/articles/2010/06/04/apprenticeship-patterns-the-white-belt/

Humility is an essential requirement for wearing the white belt.
When you wear the white belt, you set aside your expertise.  You cannot
simultaneously ask a mentor for help while reminding her that in some
areas you have more experience than she does.  It just doesn’t work.
You have to be willing to be the dumb one.  Sometimes, in the midst of
hearing a few things you need to know, you’ll also get an earful of
stuff you already know.  Repeatedly butting in with “I know that” only
ends the lesson too quickly.  Rather than explaining how much you
already know, try rephrasing what your “sensai” is saying, or better
yet, apply it to a particular context.  In this way you can demonstrate
that you’re apprehending what your hearing.

nb montypython average air speed unladen europe swallow holy grail
http://www.style.org/unladenswallow/

Although a definitive answer would of course require further measure-
ments, published species-wide averages of wing length and body mass,
initial Strouhal estimates based on those averages and cross-species
comparisons, the Lund wind tunnel study of birds flying at a range of
speeds, and revised Strouhal numbers based on that study all lead me
to estimate that the average cruising airspeed velocity of an unladen
European Swallow is roughly 11 meters per second, or 24 miles an hour.

nb perl array push unshift pop shift 
Array variables: Adding and removing elements.
http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlarrays.php

push() adds an element to the end of an array.  unshift() adds an
element to the beginning of an array.  pop() removes the last element
of an array.  shift() removes the first element of an array.
When adding elements using push() or shift() you must specify two
arguments, first the array name and second the name of the element to add.
Removing an element with pop() or shift() only requires that you send
the array as an argument.

nb perl file special variable $| dollar sign pipe automatic flush output
http://www.futureone.com/~sponge/tutorial/perl/SpecialVariables.html

Filehandle Special Variables

There are pre-existing special variables that can be associated with
filehandles.  The one most used is $| (dollar sign and pipe symbol) or
$OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH.  This variable is used to control forcing a flush
on a filehandle, be it STDOUT, a disk file, pipe or socket.  For
example, to perform non-buffered I/O to the screen, we would do the
following:

	$old_handle = select (STDOUT); # "select" STDOUT and save previously selected handle
	$| = 1;	# perform flush after each write to STDOUT
	select ($old_handle);	# restore previously selected handle

Global Special Variables

There are some other special (scalar) global variables that come into
existence as soon as your script does.  To use the more descriptive
names, place this in your script:

	use English;

A few examples of some of the variables I use the most are listed below:
 
$OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH
$|
If set to nonzero, forces a flush after every write or print on the
currently selected output channel.  Default is 0.  Note that STDOUT
will typically be line buffered if output is to the terminal and block
buffered otherwise.  Setting this variable is useful primarily when
you are outputting to a pipe, such as when you are running a Perl
script under rsh and want to see the output as it's happening.
(Mnemonic: when you want your pipes to be piping hot.)

Perl's grep() function runs a regular expression on each element of an
array, and returns only the elements that evaluate to true.  Using
regular expressions can be extremely powerful and complex.  You can
find out more about them in the regular expressions topic.

	@myNames = ('Jacob', 'Michael', 'Joshua', 'Matthew', 'Alexander', 'Andrew'); 
	@grepNames = grep(/^A/, @myNames);

nb press essence diplomacy rgates
Let me just offer some perspective as somebody who’s been at this
a long time.  Every other government in the world knows the United
States government leaks like a sieve, and it has for a long time.
And I dragged this up the other day when I was looking at some of
these prospective releases.  And this is a quote from John Adams:
“How can a government go on, publishing all of their negotiations with
foreign nations, I know not.  To me, it appears as dangerous and
pernicious as it is novel." …

Now, I’ve heard the impact of these releases on our foreign policy
described as a meltdown, as a game-changer, and so on.  I think—
I think those descriptions are fairly significantly overwrought.
The fact is, governments deal with the United States because it’s in
their interest, not because they like us, not because they trust us,
and not because they believe we can keep secrets.

Many governments—some governments deal with us because they fear us,
some because they respect us, most because they need us.  We are still
essentially, as has been said before, the indispensable nation.
So other nations will continue to deal with us.  They will continue to
work with us.  We will continue to share sensitive information with
one another.  Is this embarrassing?  Yes.  Is it awkward?  Yes.
Consequences for U.S.  foreign policy?  I think fairly modest.

dual-persona model for data storage on devices, “with support in the
BlackBerry Enterprise Server.  This allows enterprises to protect
enterprise data without having to inhibit the personal use of the
device.  With dual persona, enterprise data is protected.  We limit
the ability of the user to move data across the enterprise realm to
the personal domain.” Dual persona will keep enterprise data on the
server, where third-party applications cannot access it without
authorization, said Brenner.

I have not seen anything like what is described in this article.
I don't doubt that the large contingent of actors in our airport
security theatre harbors a very few prima donnas and scary freaks,
but I haven't met any.  Everyone I dealt with was professional,
and usually a bit bored.  I went through a backscatter machine once
(in future I will ask for a pat-down instead, less risk of grope than
of skin/testicular cancer), when I didn't take off my glasses, but
have been through only the metal-detectors since, and had no
pat-downs.  It probably helps that I'm male, white, middle-aged,
clean-cut, calm, and dress professionally (slacks and buttoned,
collared shirt).  Even customs has been easy on me, probably again
because I travel for business and carry no physical trade goods.

A dictionary of the beggars and gypsies cant.
The first English dictionary of slang, 1699.

It’s a shame that so many very apt words fall out of common use over
time, like “blobber-lippd,” which means having lips that are very thick,
hanging down, or turning over; and “chounter”, which is to talk pertly,
and sometimes angrily.  Both words can be found in /The First English
Dictionary of Slang/, originally published in 1699 as /A New Dictionary
of Terms, Ancient and Modern, of the Canting Crew/ by B. E. Gentleman.
Though a number of early texts, beginning in the sixteenth century,
codified forms of cant—the slang language of the criminal underworld—
in word lists which appeared as appendices or parts of larger volumes,
the dictionary of 1699 was the first work dedicated to slang words and
their meanings.  It aimed to educate the more polite classes in the
language and, consequently, the methods of thieves and vagabonds,
protecting the innocent from cant speakers and their activities.
	This dictionary is also the first that attempts to show the
overlap and integration between canting words and common slang words.
Refusing to distinguish between criminal vocabulary and the more
ordinary everyday English of the period, it sets canting words side by
side with terms used in domestic culture and those used by sailors and
laborers.  With such a democratic attitude toward words, this text is
genuinely a modern dictionary, as well as the first attempt by
dictionary makers to catalog the ever-changing world of English slang.
	Reproduced here with an introduction by John Simpson,
chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, describing the history
and culture of canting in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as
well as the evolution of English slang, this is a fascinating volume for
all who marvel at words and may wish to reclaim a few—say, to dabble in
the parlance of a seventeenth-century sailor one day and that of a
vagabond the next.

Use ligatures and accents since Unicode (UTF-8) is in most browsers,
prevalent office-application fonts, and text editors.


nb style justify paragraph line break pause colon comma period semicolon quote
Start with ragged-right justify at 72, to keep space for longer lines.
Adjust word position to break lines at natural pauses when speaking.
Don't keep only one word of a phrase at end or beginning of line.


nb style code formatter consistent indent tab
Use code formatters to enforce a consistent style.  Use tabs to indent,
so everyone sees lines indented as many space-equivalents as they like.


nb style code map reduce filter for loop body
Replace for loops with map, reduce, and filter, moving for-loop bodies
into named functions, to add description, addressability for test,
and fixed interface, and drive code from (test) data in collections.


nb style refactor version control
Refactor mercilessly to optimize code and reflect current
understanding of program.  Use the version-control system to record
now-unnecessary, deleted code.


nb style test comment
Prefer tests to comments.  They reflect reality, are executable, when
the code changes they break, and they provide a tutorial on code usage.
Save comments for justification and discussion of rejected alternatives.
