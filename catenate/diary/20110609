Beyond build automation: Navigate, run, and work with your builds in
your preferred development environment.  Keep the build green: Monitor
the health of your code and react quickly to things that go wrong.
JIRA integration: Easily view builds related to an issue, link builds
to JIRA issues, and put build metrics on your information radiators.
Scaling up: Get faster feedback and test more configurations by setting
up remote agents behind your firewall or in the Amazon EC2 cloud.
Agile teams: Keep the build stable, react quickly to failed builds,
and deploy continuously.  Release management: Automate your release
workflow with JIRA and Bamboo.  Plugins and extensions: Customise and
extend Bamboo for your specific needs.  Choose from a list of plugins
and extensions, or build your own.

patricksm: Bamboo has improved enough to competes favorably with
Electric Cloud's Electric Commander, and at a greatly reduced cost.
