Hacking Human Systems, by Jeff Smith

	A system is connected elements moving to a purpose, which
should be judged by its actual behavior.  Stocks are the elements of
the system which are seen, felt, counted, or measured (eg, the balance
of a bank account).
	Systems have feedback loops: eg, spending more time at
(hourly-paid) work increases bank account balance, and decreases
opportunities to spend it, so balance increases for two reasons.
Additional money in account increases the amount of interest accrued,
which is reinforcing feedback (and a third way to increase the balance).
	Change control systems are said to manage change and risk,
but actual effect is to limit the number and frequency of changes.
	Actual effect of security audit is to manage known risks...
