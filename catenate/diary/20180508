Ultimately, Gordon's central argument cites the fact that the Masoretes,
(who were the foremost medieval Jewish scribes) did not pronounce the
name and so omitted the middle vowel: the Cholam ("o" sound), when
copying manuscripts, to prevent their fellow Jews from simply reading
the name as it was written.⁲  In the past 2 decades he has found several
places in each of over 100 ancient Hebrew manuscripts where a complete
set of vowels appear for YHVH.  The complete vowels were most likely
mistakenly written in by scribes in ancient times as they copied the
text and they lost concentration for a moment.  The only time full
sets of vowels were found in these documents they spelled out
"Ye-ho-VAH".ⁱ
