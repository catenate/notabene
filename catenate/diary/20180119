The only trail to R'lyeh is recorded on driftwood Inuit maps of the
Aleutian islands.  These objects are not precious in and of themselves,
but are made precious by the art and science used to turn them into
reliable maps and guides.

The peninsula driftwood map shows the home and fishing areas of the
tribe that made these maps.  It is the most recently made and intricate,
with each inlet notched many times.

The keys driftwood map locates the waypoint island within a currently
sparse section of the Aleutian islands.  It is much older than the
peninsula map, workmanlike, and unadorned.

The island driftwood map is a human map an earlier, lower coastline of
the waypoint island.  It is roughly-carved, as if made by necessity
and reluctantly.  It notes with a disturbing symbol (a stylized
outline of one of the Elder Race) the location of the hidden map of
scarred, burnt, bouyant bone (of a bipedal, heavy inhuman, to judge
from the thickness and wear, with wildly divergent DNA), created by an
unknown hand of different dimensions than people's, carbon-dated to be
older than people were ever supposed to be in that area of the world,
during continental drift closer to Pangaea.

The sunken island bone map is an Elder Race map of the shore of
R'lyeh (made from a truly ancient marine creature that the Elder Race
used for food), which notes the location of the sacrificial altar of
Cthulhu.  It necessarily shows a different, much earlier coastline,
with a much lower amount of water, showing submerged details and
location of a cave inlet, the gaping maw of Cthulhu.  Intricately
scrimshawed with imaged of proto-human exposure, by inhuman figures
with their backs turned, to the Elder Sign that represents the Old One
that this Elder Race knew not to depict, lest it draw power from the
imagining.
