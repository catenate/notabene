nb tattoo sea scar

“I have a tattoo, right here, on my ribcage that says, ‘the sea,’” I
told a fishmonger when we chatted, during one of my visits, over a tub
of fire-engine red tentacles.  I pointed to a spot on my side for
reference.

He laughed in a way that made me wince.  He then traced over his body:
a jagged scar on his hand from a knife, a gash on his bicep from a
crate of kelp, a once-broken rib or three.  “I have tattoos of the sea
here, and here, and here…”
