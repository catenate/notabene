nb sumologic status gmex forum app os dev kb_waiting

jason.catena: Sumologic PoC status: We are working today on finishing
the setup for gmex hosts and deploying it to them, and then setting up
fix and trade gateways.

justin: I'm super into this, will have CFT be an early adopter for whatever
we go with.

jason.catena: What would help, at the moment, is to create a list of
the log files you would like to retrieve for each of your team's
applications, correlated with the repo which contains the app's
ansible configuration.

matt: ¹ Log there¹ or it doesn't exist :). Ruby apps (via cap).²
  ¹ /var/log/seedcx/*
  ² /opt/seedcx/${app}/shared/logs/${env}.log

jason.catena: Sumologic status: deployed collectors to gmex hosts in
dev environment, so we're collecting app and os logs for the main
Forum* apps.
