nb oracle plsql commit / forward slash

COMMIT.  Use the COMMIT statement to end your current transaction
and make permanent all changes performed in the transaction.
A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements that Oracle Database
treats as a single unit.  This statement also erases all savepoints in
the transaction and releases transaction locks.

/ executes the most recently executed SQL command or PL/SQL block
which is stored in the SQL buffer.  You can enter a slash (/) at the
command prompt or at a line number prompt of a multi-line command.
The slash command functions similarly to RUN, but does not list the
command.

[I]t is bad⁲ to use the forward slash following a single SQL statement
(not in a PL/SQL block), especially when that slash immediately
follows a DML statement (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).ⁱ

  ⁲ The command in the buffer will execute again.
