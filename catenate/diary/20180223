Elverson (1975)
ey laughs
I hugged em
eir heart warmed
that is eirs
ey loves emself

In 1975, Christine M. Elverson of Skokie, Illinois, won a contest by the
Chicago Association of Business Communicators to find replacements
for "she and he", "him and her", and "his and hers".  Her "transgender
pronouns" ey, em, and eir were formed by dropping the "th" from they,
them, and their.ⁱ  (See 'em.)  The article that first reported the pronouns
treated them as something of a joke, concluding with the line, "A contestant
from California entered the word 'uh' because 'if it isn't a he or a she, it's uh,
something else.' So much of eir humor."
