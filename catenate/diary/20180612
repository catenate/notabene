nb sam harris reason evidence argument free speech justification converge conscience

Reason and a respect for evidence and argument is the only algorithm
that gets people who are arbitrarily disparate to converge [in conscience],
given the same set of experiences, facts, pressures, and incentives.
We must frame our public discourse so people are willing to reason
together: you should never be killed for thinking out loud, and we should
be highly tolerant of disagreement.  Free speech must be core to our
values, because it is the only error-correcting mechanism we have.
All we have is conversation, to affect these changes in ourselves:
it is the way we rewrite the software that is culture; and it is the way
we do science; and it is the way we overcome bias; and it is the way
we counter dogma that isn’t actually guiding us in reality, because
it’s wrong.  There are very few things that we should hold sacred and
unchanging, but respect for free speech is one of them.
