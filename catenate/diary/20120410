Stephen Wolfram recently published an analysis of personal data he has
collected since 1989, on emails sent and received, keystrokes,
calendar event times, phone call times and durations, walking steps
taken, and type of file modified, all versus hour of the day.  There
is also a graph of book chapters modified over time, apparently with
intensity of color showing completeness of change.
