nb rosetta code program language chrestomathy compare task solution
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Help:Similar_Sites

Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site.  The idea is to
present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as
possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different,
and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in
learning another.  Rosetta Code currently has 518 tasks, and is aware
of 384 languages, though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to
every task in every language.

Read the details of the problem very carefully and make note of any
example cases given.  Experiment with pencil and paper to get a feel
for the ideas behind the problem.  If the ideas are new to you,
use the internet or books to get some background; the problem should
contain clues as to what to look-up.  Try writing a program to
generate for simple cases and check that your output agrees with the
example cases; this will confirm you've understood the problem and are
heading in the right direction.  Based on this try to extrapolate to
estimate the time it will take to get the final answer and if it's
going to take significantly more than a minute rethink your strategy.


nb chrestomathy collect choose literature passage sequence example text develop language style compare program syntax semantic idiom
Chrestomathy¹ is a collection of choice literary passages,
used especially as an aid in learning a foreign language.
In philology or in the study of literature, it is a type of reader or
anthology which presents a sequence of example texts, selected to
demonstrate the development of language or literary style.
In computer programming, a program chrestomathy² is a collection of
similar programs written in various programming languages, for the
purpose of demonstrating differences in syntax, semantics and idioms
for each language.
 ¹ Pronounced krɛsˈtɑːmʌθiː/kres-TA-muh-thee from the Greek words
khrestos, useful, and mathein, to know
 ² This term is thought to have been first used by Eric S. Raymond in
the Retrocomputing Museum web site.  It is used by analogy to a
linguistic chrestomathy.

nb devops automate process build deploy test release hardware system environment
Humble, J.  20110510.  Tired of playing ping-pong with dev, QA and ops?
CIO update.
http://www.cioupdate.com/trends/print.php/11047_3933106_1

Apply agile practices to the work of operations.  In particular,
aggressively automate build, deploy, test, and release processes for
hardware and system environments.  … This requires operations people
to work with developers from early on to automate provisioning,
deployment and monitoring of environments and systems under
development.  Meanwhile testers work with developers—throughout the
delivery process—to create comprehensive suites of automated
regression tests that validate that every change to the system meets
established business needs and can be deployed with minimal risk of
defects or system failure.  … First, it requires an organizational
culture where developers, testers and operations teams collaborate
throughout all phases of the service lifecycle.  Second, it requires
the adoption of agile techniques by operations teams such as
aggressive automation, comprehensive environment configuration
management and test-driven systems evolution.  And, finally, it
involves the adoption of new tools such as cloud computing stacks,
test automation frameworks and systems monitoring tools.

nb coder programmer age answer question stack overflow reputation quantity quality
Knego, P. -20110613.  It's official: developers get better with age,
and scarcer.  Peter's blog about coding and stuff.
http://coding-and-more.blogspot.com/2011/06/its-official-developers-get-better-with.html

Senior developers ask fewer questions and provide more answers.
A 40-year old coder provides about 100 answers, roughly double the
answers of his half younger colleague.  … Quality of posts does not
significantly change with age.  Number of upvotes varies about 10%
across all ages.  So, senior coders earn their higher reputation by
providing more answers, not by having answers of (significantly)
higher quality.

nb cpp header search directory path
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/where-standard-system-include-directory-is-defined-gcc-466068/

If you want to get a listing of what search directories are supported
by default, try running this command: `cpp -v < /dev/null` This runs
the GNU C Preprocessor with no input; in the process it will print
(given the -v flag) the inclusion directory search paths.  You should
see phrases like "#include <...> search starts here:" followed by a
list of directories.  Those are your standard inclusion search paths,
in the order that they're searched.

os -T cpp-3 -v </dev/null >[2=1] | sed -n '/^#include <...> search starts here:$/,/^End of search list.$/p' | sed '1d;$d;s,^ *,,'

os -T cpp-3 -v </dev/null >[2=1] | sed -n '/^#include "..." search starts here:$/,/^End of search list.$/p' | sed '1d;$d;/^#include <...> search starts here:$/d;s,^ *,,'
