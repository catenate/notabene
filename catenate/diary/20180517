nb society humanist judaism define jew self identify

The Society for Humanistic Judaism defines a Jew as "someone who
identifies with the history, culture and fate of the Jewish people".
In their view it is therefore possible for a non-religious individual
to adopt Judaism and join a Humanistic Jewish community, and for the
Society for Humanistic Judaism to adopt the person wanting to be part
of the Humanistic Jewish family.  As Israeli author Amos Oz puts it,
"a Jew is anyone who chooses or is compelled to share a common
fate with other Jews".ⁱ  Oz summed up his position more succinctly
in a monologue published in Tikkun, saying "Who is a Jew?  Everyone
who is mad enough to call himself or herself a Jew is a Jew."⁲
