Sam Harris: One thing we absolutely agree about is that freedom of
speech is not just one among many different values, it really is the
master value, because it’s the only corrective to human stupidity.
It’s the only mechanism by which we can improve our society, and in
fact it’s the value that allows us to improve our other values, through
conversation.

Jordan Peterson: Yes that's exactly right, it’s the fundamental value
upon which our entire cultural edifice is predicated, and I believe
that that’s part of the reason why the postmodern radicals in
particular are opposed to freedom of speech: because they don’t
believe in dialogue, they don’t believe in rationality, they don’t
believe that groups who have different orientations of power can
discuss their differences in a civilized manner and reach resolution,
because that isn’t how they see the world.  That’s how modernists see
the world, but post-modernists don’t believe any of that.  And they
seriously don’t believe that, it’s not a façade, it’s a very entrenched
part of their philosophy.  So that’s part of why they block speakers,
who oppose their views, from campus, and why they’re perfectly willing
to shut them down, and why they have the no-platforming policies,
which is basically the decision not to let anyone who holds alternative
views have a forum, even.  It's because they don’t believe in rational
dialogue and the possibility of reaching a solution through it.
