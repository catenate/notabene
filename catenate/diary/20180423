We need to be incentivized [though culture] as we are to effortlessly
be better and coöperate better, and I think ultimately conversation is
the only tool we have [to change us to get there].

…

Conversation is the most important thing, because I think ideas matter
more than anything else.  Bad ideas are what get good people to do
terrible things, and so the criticism of bad ideas and the explication
of better ideas is really I think what we need to do as human beings
at this moment.  That touches everything, touches science, touches
politics, touches just how we have our personal relationships and the
kind of things we do on social media, and don’t do.  It is a matter of
changing people’s minds, in the end.
