nb heather color landscape words scot gælic  maoim warp skruid glaab roke na luin summer geese

The way to appreciate places is through a precision that would speak
not of “heather,” but of the many colors a heathery slope might hold,
and the sources of those colors: blueberries that shine green and
scarlet as well as blue; sage-green bog myrtle, golden tormentil,
blue milkworts, spaghnum mosses that run to yellow, green, and pink.

There are many Gælic words for peat, specifying whether it has been cut,
how dark and heavy it is, and the form in which it has been stacked —
 and there is a word, maoim, for “a place on the moor where there has
been peat movement in the past.”

There are words for the mixture of fine sand and mud left in meadowland
where a flood has receded (warp, Northamptonshire); a steep, slippery
place where the loose earth has been washed away by weather (skruid,
Shetland); and an opening between hills through which a distant object
is visible (glaab, also Shetland).  Roke is fog that rises in the evenings
from water meadows in East Anglia, na luin is Gælic for fast-moving heat
haze on a moor, and summer geese are the wisps of steam that rise from
a North Yorkshire moor when hot sunshine comes fast behind a rain.
