nb acme sac virtual file system mount host inferno name space plan9 mac windows
web 'http://hackerne.ws/item?id=2428162'

I know this isn't a tech support forum, but in a fit of lunacy I
figured I'd give Acme a try last night (the Acme-SAC version) and
after using it for an hour of so I can't even figure out how to open a
text file (it seems like it has its own virtual directory structure
that I can't seem to navigate out of).  Anybody here successfully
using Acme for coding?
