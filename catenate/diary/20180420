Jacobs, L.  Idolatry: The ultimate betrayal of God.  My Jewish learning.

“… nowhere in the Bible are the other nations condemned for worshipping
their gods, only for the “abominations” attendant on that worship.”

“A whole tractate of the Talmud, Tractate Avodah Zarah, is devoted to
the laws against idolatry and idolatrous practices.”

Don’t do business with pagans around festival days, to give them the
objects they need for their idol worship.

“It is stated (4:7) that the Jewish elders were asked in Rome why God
does not destroy idols if he hates them so.  To this the elders replied
that men worship the sun, moon, and stars and God refuses to destroy
the world He has created “because of fools”.  If, on the other hand,
He were to destroy only those idols for which the world has no use,
this would confirm the worshippers of the idols that were not destroyed
that these alone had power.”ⁱ
  ⁱ A bit of sophistry which justifies an otherwise active god taking no action.
If, on the other hand, god only acts through people, then this logic
justifies them taking no action, perhaps motivated by the desire to
avoid antagonizing host cultures, or other nations, with different beliefs.

“In the Jewish tradition, even the Torah is to be seen as a means to God,
never as an object of worship.  Some authorities go so far as to forbid
Jews to bow to the Torah since this might seem to treat the Torah as
an object of worship.  The custom is to bow to the Torah but only as
one bows as a token of respect, to a human being.  The Torah in
Judaism [in that it is not viewed as itself divine] is more akin to
Muhammad in Islam than to Jesus in Christianity.”

“The Hasidic master, Shneur Zalman of Liady [1745-1813] sees
idolatry not as a denial of God but as an attempt at insubordination.
Man desires to have a little corner of life apart from God’s all‑
embracing power,ⁱ and the idols he sets up are his means of
effecting the separation between God and that part of life man
wishes to call completely his own.  Hence, for the Rabbis, pride is
equivalent to idolatry because both commit the same offence of
insubordination.”
  ⁱ The desire here is to be inconsistent.  To submit part, but not all,
of the daily dealings of life, or indeed some principle, to the demands
of saiche (ֵחיַס).⁲  To be excused from understanding, to dishonestly
explain away; to dismiss, overrule, or improperly quiet conscience; or
to still oneself from exercising the duty of action.
  ⁲ On balance, morally correct and justifiable acts, intuited by conscience,
deduced from practical knowledge, which guide others on the path to
living well together.

“‘Pride is truly equivalent to idolatry.  For the main root principle
of idolatry consists in man’s acknowledgement of something existing in
its own right apart and separate from God’s holiness,⁲ and does not
involve a complete denial of God” (Tanya, chapter 22).”
