nb laïcité secular identity sectarian

… The rise of Islamism in France poses an existential threat to the
republican idea, and to the bedrock principle of laïcité, or secularism—
the notion that sectarian identities must be subsumed to the concept
of Frenchness.

“I don’t see Jews as a _community_,” [Marine Le Pen] said.  “I see
fellow countrymen who are of Jewish faith but who are fellow
countrymen, and I think that all French have the right to see
themselves protected from the threats that weigh on them.”

… unrestricted debate … is the only way other than force of arms to
retain or return freedom of expression to those who have lost it.

…

≈We shall redefine the right of free speech.  Not as free—which is to
say _unrestricted_—utterance of ideas and beliefs.  But as to restrict,
objectively, the speech of some, so that others may feel empowered and
emancipated.  The unrestricted free speech of some restricts, subjectively
experienced, the free speech of others, because of how those others
feel in response to such speech.≈

…

Both deny equal participation in that community to those they
characterize as offensive to them, on the basis of the aggrieved’s
subjective, felt experience, reconfigured as an objective detriment.

“Debate,” he informed, “means you are trying to win.  Dialectic means
you are using disagreement to discover what is true.  I am not interested
in debate.  I am interested only in dialectic, which does mean, I listen to you,
and you listen to me.”

It is no accident that the students’ own speech is so foul and disrespectful,
indeed, dehumanizing.  Recall that, according to Baer, current free
speech standards are such that “public discourse discards the
categories of true/false and just/unjust in favor of valuing the mere
fact that something is being communicated.” These students are
communicating their feelings.  Feelings are raw, the raw is the real,
and to speak as new-form intellects who remain, nonetheless, still in
touch with their roots is to mix ideological, social-justice-theory
jargon with the language of the streets.  To reason coolly in the
dialectic that, as Weinstein would have it, seeks truth is to practice
and accede to the white male hegemon, the Western imperium.
It is, further, to be coopted, and to fall for the long political con,
for anyone merely, carefully – quaintly – simply to disagree;
to be revolutionary means to call bullshit.  (David Palumbo-Liu:
“Civility is for Suckers.”)  Thus, it is no accident either that
Weinstein and those who supported him on campus, including other
students, have been harassed and threatened with doxing, that
Weinstein was told by campus police that they could not guarantee his
safety on campus, and that he has, unsupported by Bridges, had to
absent himself from Evergreen.

Albert Camus wrote in _The Rebel_: “[I]n no case, if he is consistent,
does [the rebel] demand the right to destroy the existence and the
freedom of others.  He humiliates no one.  The freedom he claims,
he claims for all; the freedom he refuses, he forbids everyone to enjoy.
He is not only the slave against the master, but also man against the
world of master and slave.”

Human dignity begins in freedom.  It is not a utility, an instrument
to some greater value.  Every experience of liberty is its own value,
every occasion of freedom its own end.  Freedom of speech is the
final act, in utterance, of the freedom to learn, to know, to think, and,
finally, to be.  Freedom is not full human dignity.  It is merely the
beginning of dignity.  But as that beginning, it is the foundation for
all that adds to it.  Whenever we subordinate it to other ends, but
most especially that which seeks to place itself beyond reason, and
within the virtue of its own inherent passion, we grant license for
freedom to be taken away.  We must not do that.  We must not be
fooled again.  The end [aim or goal] of free speech [speaking freely]
will be free speech [for all], or it will be the end [absence] of free
speech [for anyone].
