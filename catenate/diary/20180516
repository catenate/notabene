nb tikkun leil shavuot summary jewish library

In keeping with the custom of engaging in all-night Torah study,
the Arizal, a leading Kabbalist of the 16th century, arranged a
special service for the evening of Shavuot.  The Tikkun Leil Shavuot
("Rectification for Shavuot Night") consists of excerpts from the
beginning and end of each of the 24 books of Tanakh (including the
reading in full of several key sections such as the account of the
days of creation, The Exodus, the giving of the Ten Commandments and
the Shema) and the 63 books of Mishnah, followed by the reading of
Sefer Yetzirah, the 613 commandments as enumerated by Maimonides,
and excerpts from the Zohar, with opening and concluding prayers.
The whole reading is divided into thirteen parts, after each of which
a Kaddish di-Rabbanan is recited when the Tikkun is studied with a minyan.
This service is held in most communities, with the notable exception
of Spanish and Portuguese Jews.

The service is printed in a special book, itself also called Tikkun
Leil Shavuot.  There exist similar books for the vigils before the
seventh day of Pesach and Hosha'ana Rabbah.
