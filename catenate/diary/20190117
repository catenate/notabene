nb continuous integration cicd certification martin fowler

Martin Fowler argues that we don't really need a certification for
continuous integration, we just need to actually do it.  So while
companies do offer certification in CI, we might be better off
figuring out how we can make these practices work in our environment.

A Terraservice has its own CI/CD pipeline.  The pipeline runs unit,
integration and compliance tests.  It can even autogenerate
documentation.

The integration and compliance tests run in a sandbox environment, and
spin up their own test harnesses to exercise changes the Terraservice.

At the end of the pipeline, when tests are green, the Terraservice is
versioned and tagged.
