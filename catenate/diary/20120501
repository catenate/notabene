     Mail
          In the directory /acme/mail there are two mail programs that
          may be used under acme. These Mail and Mailpop3 can be run
          to display the user's current mail, read the mail, reply to mail,
          save or delete mail, send mail and write the user's mail box.

          The former expects the user's mail box to be in the directory
          and file specified as its first argument, the latter uses the POP3
          protocol to connect to a server for the user's mail and will
          prompt for a password when first run. Otherwise their
          behaviour is the same.

In your /lib/ndb/local set the smtp and pop3 variables for you site, e.g.,
infernosite=
	smtp=smtp.gmail.com
	pop3=imap.gmail.com

Log into inferno as the user you want to connect to your mail account.
Set the DOMAIN environment variable for example
  DOMAIN=comcast.net

/appl/acme/acme/mail/Mailpop3.b:/DOMAIN/
/lib/ndb/local

DOMAIN=gmail.com
