nb torah study law idolatry allow require 

Thus, in the context of Torah study, not only are we _allowed_ to
study the various forms of idolatry, we _must_.
	Spiritually, we are required to study the laws of forbidden
things (of which idolatry is only one instance) because, through
direct contact, we can only elevate the permitted elements of the
physical world.  … Man elevates these forces by using them for a holy
purpose, … [but] they are intrinsically evil and we cannot elevate
them by immersing ourselves in them.ⁱ ⁲ ⁳
  ⁱ web 'https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/677800/jewish/A-Closer-Look-at-Idol-Worship.htm'
  ⁲ This is how to study something bad without being tainted by it:
study its laws in the abstract, but not through direct experience.
  ⁳ With the power of the Torah, our vicarious journey through idolatry
(and other "forbidden zones") has the capacity to transform its
spiritual darkness to light.—Ed.


nb baal worship history sex ashtar ashtoreth

The noxious elements in such Ba'al-Worship were not simply the
degradation of Yhwh and the enthronement in his place of a baseless
superstition.  The chief evil arose from the fact that the Ba'als were
more than mere religious fantasies.  They were made the symbols of the
reproductive powers of nature, and thus their worship ministered to
sexual indulgences, which it at the same time legalized and encouraged.
Further, there was placed side by side with the Ba'al a corresponding
female symbol, the Ashtoreth (Babyl.  "Ashtar") and the relation
between the two deities was set forth as the example and the motive of
unbridled sensuality.  The evil became all the worse when in the
popular view Yhwh himself was regarded as one of the Ba'als and the
chief of them (Hosea ii. 16).  It was in northern Israel, where agriculture
was more followed than in the southern kingdom, that Ba'al-Worship was
most insidious and virulent.ⁱ
