nb train practice complex system individual perform art simple
Aggressive, planned, intentional simplicity is the only defence against
complexity.  Remove redundant features.  Combine multiple ways to do
things into fewer mechanisms, embedded languages, or methods, with
smaller interfaces.¹ Translate expanded features into combinations of
primitives.² Training, or learning a complex system through practice,
is an individual performance art.  Proficiency decays with time as the
system and its external environment change.
 ¹ E.g. plan9/inferno's treatment of the unix API.
 ² E.g. head becomes sed 11q or sed '11,$d' to read all input.
cat -n becomes awk -f /lib/awk/linenum.
