*	In good conscience,
√	be prepared to do
☺	cheerfully
↑	the best you can within these limits.

imperfect
never quite fit for purpose
presence changes environment and therefore purpose
environment changes on its own and so must adapt
flaws are part of necessary compromises to make something real
some aspects preclude others
nobody's perfect
nothing is perfect

impermanent
not lasting
temporary
transient
doomed to an uncertain fate
wear from use
wear from resource battles with other things
wear from natural surroundings
undone
nothing lasts (forever)

incomplete
unfinished
not done
never expressing all it should
not expressing all it needs to
always lacking incorporation of some aspect ofenvironment
can't have everything
the more you try to do all things, or be all to all, or satisfy all, the less well each is done, and the poorer they work together
nothing is finished

than any other person can be.  ―Jane Austen
