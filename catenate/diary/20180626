nb rabbi danny burkeman parsha bakal trust conscience

Rabbi Daniel Burkeman.  20180626.Balak: Trusting your gut.
Two minutes of Torah podcast.

“You should listen to your [conscience], it knows everything;
your head knows only some things.”―Henry Winkler

Generally our [conscience] has a sense about the right and wrong
way to behave.  When we are successful it is often because we have
listened to our [conscience], because it knows what we are really
truly feeling deep down inside.

Despite thinking that maybe intellectually the reward was good,
God’s voice—pehaps his [conscience]—told him this maybe isn’t
the best thing to be doing.

He cannot fulfill the task that he was supposed to fulfill, because he
didn’t listen to God.  And for us, as an example perhaps, he didn’t
listen to his [conscience].  I think that he deep down knew that if
[his conscience] was against this plan, it was not going to work,
and yet he did it anyway.

But he should have said no.  He should have listened to the voice—
in his case the external voice of God; in our case, the voice that
comes from within us—telling him what was the right thing to do,
and what was wrong.  But he ignored it.  And in ignoring it, we see
the repercussions of that action.  For us, we might not have the voice
of God telling us what to do and what not to do.  But we do have our
[conscience], the voice that comes from within us.  And often, that
voice knows much much more than we give it credit for.

[conscience replaces gut, guts, or instinct]
