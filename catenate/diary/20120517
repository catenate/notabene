Russell's life story, depicted by Logicomix, is itself a journey
through the goals and struggles, and triumph and tragedy shared by
many great thinkers of the 20th century: Georg Cantor, Ludwig
Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, Alfred North Whitehead, David Hilbert,
Gottlob Frege, Henri Poincaré, Kurt Gödel, and Alan Turing.

A parallel tale, set in present-day Athens, records the creators’
disagreement on the meaning of the story, thus setting in relief the
foundational quest as a quintessentially modern adventure.  It is on
the one hand a tragedy of the hubris of rationalism, which descends
inextricably on madness, and on the other an origin myth of the
computer.
