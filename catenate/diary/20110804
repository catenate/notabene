I advocate an explicit set -e on the second line of shell scripts instead.
As much as making shell scripts set -e is a good practice, it drives
me absolutely batty having to deal with scripts that spontaneously
exit as soon as something they run exits non-zero.  Particularly when
you've chained a bunch of shell scripts together, or have one sourcing
a bunch of script fragments from a directory.  For this reason,
I prefer to write in Bash and use an exit handler, to make it very
obvious when a shell script has abended due to set -e.

With [bash option] set -o pipefail, the return status of a pipeline is
"the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status,
or zero if all commands exit successfully".  So if some_command fails,
the whole pipeline fails, and set -e kicks in.  So you need to use
set -o pipefail and set -e together to get this effect.
