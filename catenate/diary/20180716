nb charge order magistrate justice judge conscience deuteronomy 1:16â€“17 parashat devarim 1

Hear out your fellow men, and decide justly between any man and a
fellow of our people or a stranger.  You shall not be partial in judgment:
hear out low and high alike.  Fear no man, for judgment is on our
conscience.  And any matter that is too difficult for you, you shall
bring to us and we will hear it.
