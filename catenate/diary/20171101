Actual references to mistress Liberty, and possible references to “her”.

Broken Bones:
	Mistress Liberty … abandoned thee

The most beautiful girl:
	Mistress Liberty's dance
	Held you in its trance
	Her bosoms were loaded with nectar and lances
	"Well, boys, " she said
	"You have broken the trust
	Hold on to that stick if you must"

	I'm the life that you gave
	I'm the children you saved
	I'm the promise you made
	I'm the woman you crave

Wait for her:
	And do not flush the sparrows 
	That are nesting in her braids
	All along the barricades
	Wait for her

	And as the echo fades from that final fusillade
	Remember the promises you made

Oceans apart:
	She was always here in my heart
	Always the love of my life
	We were strangers, oceans apart
	But when I laid eyes on her 
	A part of me died

Part of me died:
	[Everything in this song is the opposite of liberty.]

	But when I met you, that part of me died

	Bring me a bowl to bathe her feet in
	Bring me my final cigarette
	It would be better by far to die in her arms than to linger
	In a lifetime of regret
