The underlying MD5 algorithm is no longer deemed secure, thus while
md5sum is well-suited for identifying known files in situations that
are not security related, it should not be relied on if there is a
chance that files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered.
In the latter case, the use of a newer hashing tool such as sha256sum
is highly recommended.

Variants include shasum (which permits SHA-1 through SHA-512 hash
functions to be selected manually) and sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum
and sha512sum, which use a specific SHA-2 hash function.  Versions for
Microsoft Windows also exist.  On FreeBSD this utility is called 'sha512'
and contains additional features.

cstocks: I suggest using 1<<20 instead of 2**20, but that is just my
personal preference.  It won't improve the speed of your program
measurably.
