It is in our collective group interest for everyone to coöporate.
It is in any given individual's short-term self interest not to coöporate:
to defect, in game theory terms.  But if everyone defects, society
falls apart.  To ensure widespread cooperation and minimal defection,
we collectively implement a variety of societal security systems.

The sociopaths know that the only way to make an organization capable
of survival is to buffer the intense chemistry between the producer-
losers and the leader-sociopaths with enough clueless padding in the
middle to mitigate the risks of business.  Without it, the company
would explode like a nuclear bomb, rather than generate power steadily
like a reactor.  On the other hand, the business wouldn’t survive very
long without enough people actually thinking in cold, calculating ways.  
The average-performing, mostly-disengaged losers can create dimin-
ishing margins profitability, but not sustainable performance or growth.
You need a steady supply of sociopaths for that, and you cannot waste
time moving them slowly up the ranks, especially since the standard
promotion/development path is primarily designed to maneuver the
clueless¹ into position wherever they are needed.  The sociopaths must
be freed up as much as possible to actually run the business, with or
without official titles.
 ¹ [To avoid cognitive dissonance,] they must choose to either
construct false narratives or decline apparent opportunities.

Wooden books of Padova university.  Atlas obscura: San Vito di Cadore, Italy.
http://atlasobscura.com/place/wooden-books-padova-university

Once a collection of roughly a hundred, nearly half of these rare
wooden books have been lost or destroyed since their creation in the
late 1700s or early 1800s, leaving only 56 of these amazing objects.
Each volume is about a different species of tree, with its cover made
from the wood of that tree, showing both wood radial, longitudinal,
and cross profiles.  And on each spine is a section of the tree's bark.
Inside are the book's contents—but rather than paper describing the
tree, each book holds bits of the tree itself.  Seedlings, leaves,
roots, sawdust, charcoal, flowers, and seeds are all fastened in place
and numbered.  Each book is accompanied by a handwritten piece of
parchment with a legend explaining what each sample is. …
Modern science can now read the DNA contained in these samples.
