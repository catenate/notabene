You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, any likeness of
what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters
below the earth.  You shall not bow down to it or serve it.

for our conscience will not clear one who so swears a willful lie.

conscience; you shall not do any work, nor those obliged to you.

Honor your father and your mother, as the authority of our conscience
has commanded you, that you may long endure, and that you may fare well,
with the people that the authority of our conscience is creating in you.

You shall not murder.  You shall not commit adultery.  You shall
not steal.  You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

You shall not covet anything that is your fellow’s.
