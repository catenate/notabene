To include a backslash as a character without any special meaning
inside a character class, you have to escape it with another backslash.¹
The closing bracket (]), the caret (^) and the hyphen (-) can be included
by escaping them with a backslash, or by placing them in a position
where they do not take on their special meaning.  I recommend the
latter method, since it improves readability.  To include a caret, place
it anywhere except right after the opening bracket.² You can put the
closing bracket right after the opening bracket, or the negating caret.³
The hyphen can be included right after the opening bracket, or right
before the closing bracket, or right after the negating caret.⁴
 ¹ [\\x] matches a backslash or an x.
 ² [x^] matches an x or a caret.
 ³ []x] matches a closing bracket or an x.  [^]x] matches any
character that is not a closing bracket or an x.
 ⁴ Both [-x] and [x-] match an x or a hyphen.
