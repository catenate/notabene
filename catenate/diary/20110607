Telehack is a simulation of a stylized arpanet/usenet, circa 1985â€“1990.
It is a full multi-user simulation, including 25,000 hosts and BBSs of
the early net, thousands of files from the era, a collection of
adventure and IF games, a working BASIC interpreter with a library of
programs to run, simulated historical users, and more.
