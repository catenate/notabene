Originally, I had included a link to a website that explained the not
only the choice of lyrics (ie, “And then cried Mary” as opposed to the
commonly misheard “And then Craig Marion”) and the meaning of the
Scots words.  Unfortunately that website is now closed.  Fortunately I
managed to copy that page before it had shut down, and I can add the
text of it for this site; so not only do you get the lyrics, but what
they mean.  Please note it was not copyrighted in anyway at all.

The key to deciphering these lyrics is to have a rough idea of what
the story's about.  The first clue is the word “Claymore” which refers
to a broadsword that was popular in Scotland around the 16th century.
Because the word “Mary” is in the lyrics, I took a wild guess that
this might be an account of the famous defeat of Mary Queen of Scots
at the battle of Langside that took place in the 16th Century.
Then things just started to fall into place.  Here's my translation
with explanations below:

	Aye an a bit o' mackerel, fiddler(1), rack(2) and fear,
	And I rutted(3) down by the hade(4) and the furrow(5)
	Well, I slipped me(6) in a flop(7) and hit down(8) and I shied(9),
	And I cried, cried, cried
	The fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise(10)
	
	And then cried Mary(11) and I tucked up(12)
	Wi' a Claymore out and about(13)
	And I run down, down the mechyn sty(14),
	And back on fiery hore(15) that was fallin' around the feet
	
	"Never", I cried. "Never shall ye get me alive
	Ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae".(16)
	
	Well, I snapped(17) for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
	And I fell down before him 'round his feet.
	
	Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart
	That I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah(18)…
	
	And the wind cried Mary.

1) Fiddler -- Previously, the best available translation of this word
was settler.  It's a good attempt, but makes no sense in the context.
The beginning consonant is definitely an 'f'.  The word 'fettler' has
several meanings that would have been very familiar in the vicinity of
16th Century Glasgow, the most appropriate of which is 'a part time
worker'.  However, the word is more likely 'fiddler'.  This term, when
used in the context of other seafood (Mackerel) would have brought to
mind fiddler crabs.  It's interesting that soldier rations of the day
included mackerel and crab.

2) Rack—This word had multiple meanings in 16th Century Scotland.
Assuming this is an account of a great battle, the most appropriate
definition is “rubble associated with battle”.

3) One common definition of “rut” for that period is “route” and was
typically used in a military context.  “Rutted” would be in the sense
of ’trekked”.

4) Hade—“Hæm”, meaning “home” was an attempt for this word but it
clearly ends with a ‘d’ sound; not ‘m’.  In the mining regions, such as
the Langside area, a hade was a familiar term meaning sloping land or an
area of unplowed land.  This will make more sense after seeing item #5.

5) Furrow—To date there has been no satisfactory interpretation.
The term, if you mentally separate it from the reverb, sounds like
“furruh” (with the rolling ‘r’).  Now, a furrow is the groove formed
by a plow and, in verse, often refers to plowed land.  Taken together
with “Hade”, the picture of sloping farmland, plowed and unplowed
farmland, comes to focus.  Interestingly, Langside was at that time
surrounded by sloping farmland!  Historically, Mary’s troops had
descended from the “High Road” toward Langside as part of a troop
maneuver.  Thus the phrase “Rutted down by the Hade and the Furrow”
makes perfect sense.

6) Slipped Me—a construct typical of the day meaning simply “I slipped”

7) A “flop” is the old term for a muddy patch.

8) Hit Down—“landed hard”.

9, 10) “Shied” was a term meaning, ’to grow afraid or apprehensive”.
The whole picture, then, is of someone slipping and falling down in mud
(after all he was walking downhill through farmland) and becoming
apprehensive for some reason.  Why?—Because falling down in mud made
him think of falling down while in battle but never getting up.
Thus “…And I cried, cried, cried, the fear of fallen down aft’,
taken never back to rise.” (Shied, cried and rise all have the “ai”
sound with the Scottish accent).

11) Some interpret the next words to be “And then Craig Marion”.
The other suggested interpretation is, “And then cried Mary and…”
This interpretation makes much more sense in the context of the lines
that follow as will be shown.  Evidently, Mary Queen of Scots gives
the battle cry and then the troops charge.  Either that or the
narrator cries out Mary to indicate his allegiance and build courage
before charging.

12) “Tucked up” is the term that has been mistakenly translated
“took that” or “get out”.  In the 16th Century, when a peasant soldier
in typical garb—a long over-shirt—was ready to charge he would first
“tuck up”, which meant that he would put folds in his loose shirt and
tuck it under his belt to keep it tight.  It was this action and the
resulting folds that gave birth to the kilt as part of the traditional
Scottish military uniform.

13) About—it sounds like he’s saying “Claymore out and abott”.
Actually, “abotte” was an alternate spelling/pronunciation of “about”
at that time.

14) Mechyn Sty in the 16th Century meant “humble path”.  History
reports that Mary’s troops charged down a small path and into battle.
Remember, sty would be pronounced stay with the Scots accent.

15) Hore—Filth.  Not positive this is what he says, but if this is
right, then the narrator runs down to a field, falls in mud, gets up,
runs down a little path and then back into filth that surrounds his feet.
But why would it say “back'?  Not sure.  Another possible interpretion
is that after he runs down the path he runs onto another field
(possibly a field of battle) where blood has mixed in the ground—
a bloody mess or “fiery hore”.

16) Burnie Bræ—A burnie is a smallish river.  Bræ is pronounced like
Brew which may be the reason why some have mistakenly interpreted it
to be crew.  A Bræ is a hillside at a crook in a winding river.  Guess what?
There is a street in the Langside area called “Burnie Bræ”. Interestingly,
“Burnie Bræ” is a common place name and street name in Scotland.

17) Snapped is synonymous with snatched.

18) Feat Deah—“deah” was a common Scottish word meaning
“meaningful” or valorous.  “Feat” is a deed.  So this basically means
“deed of valor”.  He actually says something like “deah” twice and I
haven’t figured out why.  Sounds like he got it wrong the first time
and then corrected himself.

To me, it sounds like the last “deah” is just the echo.  If you
listen, there is an echo running all through the Pict’s narration.

Modern English equivalent Edit
A bit of mackerel and crab in the ruin and fear, and then I trekked
down through the hillside farmland.  I tripped and fell hard in some
mud, and I shivered, and I cried with the fear of falling in battle,
never to rise again.

And then, with the battle-cry of “Mary!”, I tucked my shirt into my
belt and I raised my sword and waved it above my head as I ran down,
down a small path, and back into the fields, the bloodied mud caking
on my feet.

“Never”, I cried.  “Never will you take me alive, you rotten dog of
Hillside Creek!”

Well, I struck for his blade, but he parried and thrust, and I fell
down before his feet.

And he cried in anguish, from the bottom of his heart, that I would
not submit, but would instead die a valorous death.

And the wind cried “Mary…”

(I admit that “Hillside Creek” isn’t the best translation, but I was
trying for a place name, and this was the best I could come up with.
Any better suggestions?)
