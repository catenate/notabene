nb respect aretha franklin song lyric

R-E-S-P-E-C-T 
Take out P-E-C

leaving R-E-S-T
asking for rest
asking for someone to come along to relieve her burden
a partner


nb temptations papa rolling stone

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
