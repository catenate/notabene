There seems to be a contradiction between Numbers 22:12 where [God]
[conscience] tells Balaam not to go with the emissaries of Balak and
verse 20 where [God][conscience] says to get up and go with them.

There is another problem.  If [God][conscience] told Balaam to go in
verse 20, why does [He][it] [get angry][bother him] in verse 22 when
he went with (v.21) these men?

The Gaon of Vilna beautifully explained that these issues hinge on two
different Hebrew words for ‘with’ – IM and IT. IM means the joining
with another not just physically, but in terms of intention, goals and
motivation.  It is being of one mind[][, in common conscience,] when
going with another.  IT only implies joining with someone in an
activity but nothing more.

When this word is conjugated, IMAHEM means ‘with them in [mind]
[conscience] and action’ whereas ITAM just means ‘with them in
action alone’.

Here is a summary of the critical words:

v.12 Don’t go IMAHEM
v.20 Go ITAM
v.21 He goes IM the emissaries 
v.22 [God gets angry][conscience bothers him]

At first, [God][conscience] told Balaam not to go IMAHEM (verse 12,
with them—the emissaries).  This means that [God][his conscience]
was only opposed to him going with them and being of the same
mindset—which was with the intention [][in good conscience] of
cursing Israel.  When Balaam pressed his case for going[][, when he
willed to go], [God][his conscience] said he could go ITAM (verse 20—
just travelling with them), but he could not go IMAHEM.

However, verse 21 says that Balaam went IM (totally [][in common
conscience] with) the emissaries of Balak, and this is why verse 22
tells us that [God][his conscience] [was angry with him][bothered him].
