nb acme sac win label rc cd pwd path cygwin shell
loteroc@gmail.com:Thanks.  I am using rc (plan 9 shell) in windows
(compiled with cygwin) and it works fine started with ¹.  I am trying
to "re-write" the built-in cd command (as suggested in ²) as ³ but
I can't get awd.dis working.  Both ⁴ and ⁵ crashed.  And ⁶ didn't crash
but the window title didn't change.  Any idea?  Thanks for your time.
 ¹ win os rc.exe -l -i
 ² http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/1/acme
 ³ fn cd { builtin cd $1 && awd $sysname }
 ⁴ acme-0.13/sys/emu/Nt/emu awd.dis
 ⁵ acme-0.13/sys/emu/Nt/acme awd.dis
 ⁶ /cygdrive/d/acme-0.13/Acme.exe /acme/dis/awd.dis /l

arvindht@gmail.com: A simpler way is to setup the rc environment to
send out a special control sequence on cd, and have acme-sac win
update its label.  Please see ¹.  It may be necessary to rewrite the
'pwd' output in ².  For example, pwd.exe from 9pm prints
<drive>:<path>, which should be rewritten as /n/<drive>/<path>,
to enable b3 on relative file names.  I use this trick when I launch
cygwin shell from acme-sac and also when I ssh to solaris workstations
with u9fs running.
