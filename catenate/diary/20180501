nb online parsha dena weiss hadar elliott cosgrove

Dena: Good on-line parsha resources: there are two schools of thought:
the straight-up read the parsha (or a summary; you might enjoy the
godcasts), or read various people's sermons which tend to have a much
narrower focus parsha-wise, but broader focus more generally.
I really like Dena Weiss at Hadar's weekly drash (and not just because
she spells her name right); I find Elliott Cosgrove's workⁱ interesting;
most Jewish denominations have a weekly email you can receive.
I really appreciate the crapshoot aspect of reading different sermons,
but I can see real value (esp for a newcomer) to just get a straight-up
digest of the parsha.  My Jewish Learning has a pretty good one.⁲
