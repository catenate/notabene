nb online parsha dena weiss hadar elliott cosgrove

Dena: Good on-line parsha resources: there are two schools of thought:
the straight-up read the parsha (or a summary; you might enjoy the
godcasts), or read various people's sermons which tend to have a much
narrower focus parsha-wise, but broader focus more generally.
I really like Dena Weiss at Hadar's weekly drash (and not just because
she spells her name right); I find Elliott Cosgrove's workⁱ interesting;
most Jewish denominations have a weekly email you can receive.
I really appreciate the crapshoot aspect of reading different sermons,
but I can see real value (esp for a newcomer) to just get a straight-up
digest of the parsha.  My Jewish Learning has a pretty good one.⁲

nb leviticus 19:15 unfairly decision favor poor defer rich judge kin rashi ibn ezra

Michæl Skobac: “… with righteousness you shall judge your fellow.”

Sefaria: You shall not render an unfair decision: do not favor the
poor or show deference to the rich; judge your kinsman fairly.ⁱ
  ⁱ web 'https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0'

Rashi: Ye shall not do injustice in judgement.

Ibn Ezra: Do not pervert justice.

The judge is entrusted with fair consideration of cases, and fair
dispensation of the penalties of the law.  The witness is entrusted to
be telling the truth.

Rashi: Thou shalt not respect the person of the indigent, nor honor
the person of the mighty.⁲
  ⁲ Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 4 3

Ibn Ezra: a great man here denotes a wealthy man.⁵
  ⁵ cf the description of Barzillai
nb ii samuel 19:33

The judge, as well as the law, is no respecter of persons, rich or
poor, low or mighty/noble.

Rashi: In righteousness [strict right] shalt thou judge thy companion.
Another explanation is: Judge thy fellow man with an inclination in
his favour.⁳ ⁴
  ⁳ Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 4 4
  ⁴ Shevuot 30a
