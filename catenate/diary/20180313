The name of Armaund gives you a very inquisitive, restless, seeking
nature.

You feel impelled by intense desires that you cannot comprehend or
satisfy.

You have had the desire to accomplish something outstanding and to do
something very worthwhile for humanity, especially early in your life.

This name gives you a versatile, clever, analytical mind, but
unfortunately you cannot direct your interest toward an undertaking
for long, as you do not have the patience and practicality for
systematic hard work and attention to detail.

You resent obstacles, delays, and restrictions.

This name gives you ambition, high ideals, and much creative ability,
but the intense dynamic nature is too often spent in feelings and in
moods, rather than in constructive action.

You desire to be your own boss, yet you find it difficult to stabilize
your life and to settle down and be accumulative.

Your feelings swing from optimism to pessimism.

You can be very cynical and caustic, and you subject those around you
to outbursts of temper and moods of self-pity.

Your home-life particularly would suffer.

This name has given you an appreciation for refinement, and the better
things in life such as art, music, and literature.

You can express a very friendly, debonair personality to strangers
which invariably makes a very favourable impression.

It has been your experience that once you lose control to indulgent
habits, for example, smoking, drinking, or emotional outbursts, it is
very difficult to retain control.

Health Analysis: You would be affected in the health through a
sensitive solar plexus and nervous system.  Nervous disorders, nervous
indigestion, and stomach ulcers could develop.
