Chet Ramey apparently snuck a bunch of undocumented C-style constructs
into Bash (actually adapted from ksh, pretty much).  In the Bash docs,
Ramey calls ((...)) shell arithmetic, but it goes far beyond that.
Sorry, Chet, the secret is now out.  See also "for" and "while" loops
using the ((...)) construct.  These work only with Bash, version 2.04
or later.
