“The high Wizard court of law, held in a dungeon; the accused is
magically bound to a chair in the centre of the room.  A jury sits on
the right of the prosecutor who states the case against the accused
and eventually asks for a verdict.  The courtrooms are located on the
tenth level of the Ministry of Magic; during the Voldemort years,
prisoners are escorted and guarded by groups of Dementors.
The members of the Wizengamot, of which there are about fifty,
wear plum-coloured robes with elaborate silver initials on them
(the letter 'W').”
