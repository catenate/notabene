nb automate developer maintenance task

scm: I will add a TODO in the defect tracker to upgrade build boxes.

dev: And a TODO to make all the devs upgrade theirs J

me: Unfortunately, I haven't yet automated the developer control routine.
It's still a painstaking manual process with a conversational interface.
There is an automated alert facility, and an amount of peering that
raises the priority of the usually-niced process, but it seldom
directly engages with the developer's execution routine.
