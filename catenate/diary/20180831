nb weight recent build success average metric

Maybe weight the results so that all the builds older than a week have
a weight of 1; all the builds from a week ago to two (days) ago have a
weight of 2; and the past two (days of) runs have a weight of 3.
By “weight” I mean count one build as if it was several builds, so a
build in the past two (days) changes the percentage a lot faster than
a result that’s over a week old.
