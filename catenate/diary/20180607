Jacobs, Rabbi Rick.  20180607.  Optimism and hope.  On the other hand.
ReformJudaism.org.

Willful people are those people who say: “Hey, of course, everything
is going to be fine, everything is going to be rosy, when things go
the way I think they should be.”

A clear distinction between conscience and will: “Many of us confuse
conscience and will, a prevailing attitude that things should turn out
the way we want.  But conscience differs from will.  Conscience does
not arise from having things the way you want them, or from promises
that things will turn out as you will, or what you think is best for you.
Conscience, unlike will, is rooted in alloyed reality, in all its complexity
and depth.  Conscience is the elevating feeling we experience when
we see, in the mind’s eye, that we are on the right path to a better future.
Conscience acknowledges the significant obstacles and deep pitfalls
along that path, and the part we play in them.  True conscience has no
room for delusion, imposition of one’s will, or dogmatic thinking.”
―after Dr Jerome Groopman, _The anatomy of hope_
