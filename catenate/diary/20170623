nb creepy old white guy

/giphy creepy

Trying to decide what's creepiest: the frazzled, balding, white hair;
the wide, shifting eyes; the open, gap-toothed, grinning mouth; the
pale, mottled and wrinkled skin; the long, hook nose; the thin, waggling,
suggestive eyebrows; the awkward shimmy in place (hand check!); or the
bent-collared dress shirt under the featureless grey crew-neck
sweater.  Or the fact that this guy reminds me of Rick from Rick and
Morty.
