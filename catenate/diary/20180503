You’ve begun to matter more than the things you say.
No talk of god then, we called you a man.
Christianity came about revering Christ, not his teachings.
All your followers are blind, too much heaven on their minds.

They only need a small excuse to put us all away.
Let the world turn without you tonight.
People who are hungry, people who are starving, matter more than your feet and head.
There will be poor always.

The crowd crowning king which the Romans would ban.

smile at me, fight for me, die for me
crowd wants saved and given freedom
keep them yelling their devotion but add a touch of hate at rome
understand what power is, understand what glory is
to conquer death, you only have to die

he had that look you very rarely find, the haunting hunted kind

my temple should be a house of prayer

too many of you, don't push me, there's too little of me
heal yourselves

I don’t know how to love him.

For all you care this wine could be my blood
For all you care this bread could be my body
If you would remember me when you eat and drink

you liar you judas

take this cup away from me
then I was inspired; now I'm sad and tired
could you ask as much of any other man
would the things I've said and done matter any more
can you show me now that I would not have died in vain
all right I'll die

god thy will be done
I will drink your cup of poison

I don't know him
