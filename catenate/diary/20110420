But now some pretty clever researchers are finding out ways where
different languages really do influence how we think.  The effects are
a lot more subtle.  They’re very interesting, but they’re not as
dramatic or as romantic as the early versions.  … They’ve pushed back
on [Chomsky] and argue that different languages sometimes do have
different views of the world.

Key doesn’t have any inherent sex, so if you ask people to pre-
associate words with it, they’re going to grab whatever they’ve got—
and it’s probably not surprising they grab for the grammatical gender
in their language.

[Kuuk Thaayorre of northern Australia] have to remain constantly
orientated.  And it turns out that if you spin them around, put them
in a cave, or try all sorts of things to discombobulate them, they can
still unfailingly point in the right direction.  So here is one
example where you really do see that the fact their language has this
property requires their cognition to build around that in a different way.
And a group that lives right next door to them, in the same
environment, does not have that ability to orientate themselves.

Pinker, S.  The language instinct: How the mind creates language.

Pinker, S.  Words and rules.

How the brain processes language.  It turns out that you know all
these rules but you don’t even know that you know them.  They are your
internal language processing device.  And to study that is much more
fascinating than whether or not you should ….  He also shows they
don’t know what they’re talking about.  Most grammar grouches have a
fairly authoritarian approach to language.  They have this idea that
somewhere, somehow, there is somebody making rules, or that there are
just hard and fast rules that have to be enforced, and people
humiliated out of violating them.

It takes a big majority of the community of speakers over time to get
the whole meaning of a word to change so that you can finally really
say: ‘OK, this word has changed in meaning.’ … Words used to mean
completely different things, almost their opposite, if you look back
in their history.

Kenneally, C.  The first word.

To what extent were the bonobos and the chimpanzees that researchers
worked with using words?  To what extent are they using structure?
What did we share with a common ancestor?  We do see that there are
basic elements of human language in other species.

Okrent, A.  In the land of invented languages.

Arika Okrent is a proper PhD linguist and this is a great journalistic
book about the real people who have [invented artificial languages].

Lessen, W. ed.  The genius of language.

All languages are fundamentally vastly expressive, that’s one of the
tenets every linguist believes.  No linguist believes that this
language is superior and expressive; or this one is clear, and that
one is muddy; this one is logical, that one is emotional; etc.
