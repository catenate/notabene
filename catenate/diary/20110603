The 70/20/10 Model is a business resource management model pioneered
by Eric E. Schmidt and articulated about Google in 2005.  This model
dictates that, to cultivate innovation, employees of a company should
utilize their time in the following ratio: 70% of time should be
dedicated to core business tasks; 20% of time should be dedicated to
projects related to the core business; and 10% of time should be
dedicated to projects unrelated to the core business.
