nb hebrew asham םשא sin guilt offering trespass wevine

Vine, W.E.  1940.  Complete Expository Dictionary of Old & New
Testament Words.

asham (םשא, 817), “sin; guilt; guilt offering; trespass; trespass
offering.” Cognates appear in Arabic as ithmun (“sin; offense;
misdeed; crime”), athima (“to sin, err, slip”), and athimun (“sinful;
criminal; evil; wicked”); but the Arabic usage does not include the
idea of restitution.  In the Ugaritic texts of Ras Shamra, the word
atm occurs in similar passages.  Scholars believe this Ugaritic word
may mean “offense” or “guilt offering,” but this cannot be
ascertained.

Asham implies the condition of “guilt” incurred through some
wrongdoing, as in Gen. 26:10: “And Abimelech said, ...  one of the
people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou shouldest have
brought guiltiness upon us.” The word may also refer to the offense
itself which entails the guilt: “For Israel hath not been forsaken ...
though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel”
(Jer.  51:5).  A similar meaning of the word appears in Ps. 68:21:
“But God shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp of
such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses [ RSV , “guilty ways”;
NASH, “guilty deeds”].”

Most occurrences of asham refer to the compensation given to satisfy
someone who has been injured, or to the “trespass offering” or “guilt
offering” presented on the altar by the repentant offender after
paying a compensation of six-fifths of the damage inflicted (Num.
5:7- 8).  The “trespass offering” was the blood sacrifice of a ram:
“And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy
estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest
shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he
erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him” (Lev.  5:18; cf.
Lev.  7:5, 7; 14:12-13).  The most significant theological statement
containing asham is in Isa. 53:10, which says that the servant of
Yahweh was appointed as an asham for sinful mankind.  This suggests
that His death furnished a 120-percent compensation for the broken law
of God.
