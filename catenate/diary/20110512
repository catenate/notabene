nb reduce combinator gnu make sdmarlow
http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/cvs-ghc/2011-May/062100.html

marlowsd@gmail.com: If you want some make code that is hard to
understand, try this:

define ap
$(strip \
  $(if $(findstring $(dollar),$1$2),\
    $(dollar)$(lpar)call ap$(comma)$1$(comma)$2$(rpar),\
    $(if $(findstring >>$(lpar)PAP,>>$1),\
      $(subst $(space)<-TMPSPACE,$(comma),\
       $(patsubst >>$(lpar)PAP_%,$(dollar)$(lpar)call %$(comma)$2,\
	 >>$(subst $(comma),$(space)<-TMPSPACE,$1))),\
      $(dollar)$(lpar)call $1$(comma)$2$(rpar))))
endef

That's my implementation of combinator reduction in GNU make.

nb punctuate logic quote period comma
Yagoda, B. 20110512.  The rise of "logical punctuation": The period
outside the quotation marks is /not/ a copy error.  Slate: Language.
http://www.slate.com/id/2293056/pagenum/all/

Insinuating a period or comma within the unit alters it in a rather
underhanded manner.  American style is inconsistent, moreover,
because when it comes to other punctuation marks—semicolons, colons,
exclamation points, question marks, dashes—we follow British/logical
protocol.

nb independent game pirate online register pay procrastinate customer jvogel
Vogel, J.  20110511.  The final answer for what to do to prevent piracy.
The bottom feeder: Thoughts on Indie game design.
http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2011/05/final-answer-for-what-to-do-to-prevent.html

You need some way to force people to pay.  Not because they are evil
or dishonest, but because they procrastinate.  Registration is a pain.
They'd rather be spending their time playing your game!  If you don't
do anything at all to make them pay, they'll just forget.  But tread lightly.
Once you have any barrier in place at all, you'll get your payment
from all the honest people, the people who know that, if nobody pays,
you won't make more awesome games for them.  Anything beyond that will
inconvenience your paying customers and do little to nothing to
prevent piracy.
