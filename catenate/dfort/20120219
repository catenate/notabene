nb assign skill dwarf personality
http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.31:Starting_build

Which dwarf should have which skill?

Dwarves who craft goods they prefer, or work materials they prefer,
gain a bonus to the quality of the finished work.  This can inform
your choice of which skills you choose, for example by choosing a
weaver because you notice a preference for sheep wool yarn, or you
might choose the skills you want and then try to find a suitable dwarf
to use that skill.  In the latter case, since all dwarves have one
metal preference you might assign an armorsmithing skill to a dwarf
with a preference for iron, steel, or adamantine.

The dwarf with the most social skills will end up being the Expedition
leader, who will then become the mayor and start making mandates.
Thus you should avoid giving the most social skills to dwarfs who have
preferences for things like adamantine.

Dwarves have physical and mental attributes that affect the
performance of certain skills.  You may wish to give a socially adept
and patient dwarf the leadership/broker skills, or a dwarf who doesn't
tire easily a skill which will be in frequent use like mining.  You
can also try to match skills to personality, some of which have
obvious implications for their willingness to work long hours or how
frequently they might take breaks.

Of course, all combined these represent a lot of possible constraints
on where you assign particular skills, and it would be impossible to
apply them in total to your entire desired skill load.  Use these as a
guide, but don't be upset if all your dwarves are anti-social
psychopaths—someone still needs to be the leader, after all.
