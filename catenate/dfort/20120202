Kitchen: 8 cacao pod, 2 cacahautl, 4 cacao sugar, 3 cocoa butter,
8 cacao nib.  Stocks: 2 cacao pod [2], 4 cacao pod (plants); cacao sugar [2],
2 cacao sugar (powder); cacahautl [2] (drinks); 3 cocoa butter (liquid);
5 cocoa mass, 3 cocoa solid (glob).

Changed raws of region15 to match post¹, but reaction² ³ still not available.

 ² COUVERTURE_MAT-producing liquid, Cocoa butter-containing item,
COUVERTURE_MAT-producing powder, and Sugar-containing bag produce
Cocoa butter couverture.
 ³ COUVERTURE_MAT-producing liquid, Cocoa butter-containing item,
COUVERTURE_MAT-producing powder, and Sugar-containing bag produce
COUVERTURE_MAT Glob.

Try reducing reaction to just cocoa butter again, no sugar¹ or cocoa solid.²
Interesting: this doesn't make the reaction³ available.  Maybe the
object was created without the new properties, so I need to make more
cocoa butter?  Needed a new jug to store nw cocoa butter, since I'm
not yet using cocoa butter from the jugs.

Kitchen: 7 cacao seeds, 5 cacao pod, 2 cacahautl, 7 cacao sugar, 5 cocoa butter,
8 cacao nib.  Stocks: 2 cacao pod [2], cacao pod (plants); cacao sugar [2],
5 cacao sugar (powder); cacahautl [2] (drinks); 5 cocoa butter (liquid);
3 cocoa mass, 5 cocoa solid (glob), 7 cacao seeds (seeds).

Still can’t make couverture from cocoa butter.  Maybe I should change
the new has-MAT for the cocoa butter back into the reaction class.

That did it, the reactin is enabled to make couverture from cocoa
butter.  Now let’s add in the cocoa solids.  Yay!  Still can make
couverture from cocoa solid and cocoa butter (I think, can't see the
reaction details).  So it's purely the sugar that messes me up.

Cleared old cacao sugar pile, set new one to accept 0 barrels.¹

Add sugar back in and see if reaction works.  Yes!  So the problem was
that hiding cacao sugar bags in barrels makes them invisible to the reaction.

Switched back from mechanisms to stonework.

Kitchen: 7 cacao seeds, 5 cacao pod, cacahautl, 7 cacao sugar, 7 cocoa butter,
8 cacao nib.  Stocks: 2 cacao pod [2], cacao pod (plants); cacao sugar [2],
5 cacao sugar (powder); cacahautl (drinks); 7 cocoa butter (liquid);
cocoa mass, 7 cocoa solid (glob), 7 cacao seeds (seeds).

Can't make chocolate crafts yet.  Actually try to make a cocoa butter
couverture, see where it's stored, visible in the kitchen, and visible in
stocks; then craft it.

Stored in globs, listed as just a glob, rather than as a cocoa butter
couverture.  So change the product material back to what it was.¹
Craft it?  No, there apparently are no COUVERTURE_CRAFT globs.
So maybe make another one (once we get the a sugar bag out of a
barrel) that is a cocoa butter couverture.
 1 COUVERTURE glob, COUVERTURE liquid, Cocoa butter-containing item,
COUVERTURE_MAT-producing powder, and Sugar-containing bag produce
Cocoa butter couverture.

To get bags back, cook the sugar.

7 migrants.  Mistêm Syrupaxe mines, trains animals, and hunts,
so built kennel, butcher, and tanner.  Cog Armorclobbered smiths weapons,
so we need a metal industry.  Astesh Ceilingsavage dissects fish and
swims.  Mestthos Danceurn keeps bees, so we should build a beehive.
Dastot Clasplanced cooks and carves crossbows, so we need a bowyer.
Litast Wallsound gathers plants, trains animals, and is a proficient fighter,
so will captain the second militia squad, the Bolts of Delighting.
Lòr Openknives presses.  Mûthkat Inkystops hunts and keeps records.

Start military training since we have some job redundancy.
