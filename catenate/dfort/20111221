Unlike other rooms, archery ranges only include the archery target
from which they were defined—if you have multiple targets in one area,
each one must be designated as its own archery range, even if this
causes them to overlap.

Also assign the archery squad to the central barracks.

> Loud Whispers: Everything in DF goes wrong from the moment you press embark. 

The alligator Etostèrith (Containedlabors) killed
4 dwarves of The Livid Merchant expedition and
injured (pale) the mason immediately upon embark,
while crossing a 4-wide river to first cut trees
and dig out the initial fortress entrance.  After
the initial woodworker's death, the remaining six
organized the squad “The Clasps of Crying” to
extract revenge, and so they wouldn’t get whittled
down one by one.  The miner/expedition leader
dispatched the alligator, leaving only her and my
woodcutter uninjured to strike the earth and bury
their fallen comrades.  The miserable miner,
however, couldn’t take it, throwing tantrums,
going insane, and finally going berserk.  She
killed a horse, killed the injured stoneworker
(lopping off the left foot with her copper pick),
and chased around the entire embark area in the
rain after groundhogs.  Finally she interrupted
the woodcutter (now expedition leader, and set to
mining), and chased him, stray cats, and
groundhogs around, before finally dying of thirst.
The groundhogs apparently ate away her upper body
in revenge—saw them scatter just after she died.
Finally tally to last until traders and migrants
arrive at “Boatsguarded”: one sleeping dwarf, two
cats, a yak bull, and the wagon.
