Making couverture doesn’t work, so strip down the reaction to the
simplest variation that works, then build it up again to see which
lines cause problems.

nb chocolate mod test
Make new large world Emælathu to test minimized reactions.  TMBF,
warm, heavily forested, thick, wilderness.  Stream, shallow clay, very
deep soil, aquifer, shallow metals, flux stone.  Default embark to
Udiblaz Syrupscale.  Designate entrance, trees, and cacao shrubs.  Set
stoneworker to mine.  Set fish cleaner to work wax.  Set jeweler and
fish cleaner to press, cook, gather and process plants, brew, mill,
and grow.  Mine entrance and couverture-industry rooms, and stairs to
stone.  Built fishery and carpenter outside.

At crafter, make COUVERTURE_CRAFT glob into craft, when such material
is available.

Aquifer wins, no stone, no desire to learn how to punch through
aquifer just for this test.


nb chocolate mod test
Emælathu.  TCF, hot, heavily, thick, wilderness.  Brook, clay, deep
soil, shallow metal, deep metals.  Default embark to Nollogem
Tonguepainted.  Stonecrafter mines.  Jeweler works with wax.
Fish cleaner and jeweler press, cook, gather and process plants,
and grow.  Fish cleaner keeps records.  Built fishery and carpenter.
Designated refuse pile and cleared trees, plants, couverture industry
work area (piles, still, kitchen, crafter, quern, screw press, book
keeper’s chair), and barracks.  Built mason, mechanic, and jeweler.
Stopped stoneworker mining.

There’s chalk and limonite here, so I could start a metal industry.

Kitchen makes unrotten FAT glob into COUVERTURE_MAT bars, and unrotten
COUVERTURE liquid (in a cocoa butter container) into cocoa butter (chocolate?)
couverture.

Woodworker makes bins.  Piles for cut gems, mechanisms, and masonry
except mechanisms and siege items.  Mason makes qeurn, 2 floodgates,
grate, and door to trick out keep.  After, will need beds, stone
blocks, and mechanisms, to install water, zone dorm, and build
drawbridges.  Wood buckets for industries, chairs (and stone tables)
for dining room.

Kitchen: 5 cacahautl (default cook, as other alcohols), 6 cacao pod
(default brew, can't make cookable), 2 cacao seeds (default don’t cook).
Changed cacao pod to don’t brew, until couverture established.
Stocks: cacao pod [4], 2 cacao pod (plants); cacahautl [5] (drinks),
2 cacao seeds (seeds).

Activated quern and screw press.
