Couverture 0.1: a chocolate-covered mod.

Defined a new plant, cacao pod, which grows year-round on a shrub in
tropical conifer or moist-broadleaf forest biomes.  The pod can be
milled into the powder cacao sugar, brewed into the drink cacahuatl,
or extracted (if it worked) into the extract cocoa liquor.

Cacao seeds can be milled from cacao nibs into the paste cacao mass,
then pressed into the glob cocoa solids and the oil cocoa butter.

This is my first mod, so I'd appreciate any advice on how to get
things done in the raw files.  Specifically, I think I'd like for
release 0.2 to make couverture from cocoa butter in one reaction, and
in another from any fat.  This is my best guess so far.

I obviously need to replace lye with cocoa solids, which is the other
product when cocoa mass is pressed.  I'm not at all sure how to do
this, since I don't know how to refer to only cocoa solids (and supply
the other fields) in the REAGENT line.  I also think maybe my cocoa
butter reagent line is a little off, since I don't want to also use
rock nut oil, which I think LIQUID_MISC might permit.

nb chocolate mod test
Started DF. Created new world (Ushul Lathon) with default settings.
Choose tropical coniferous forest, warm, heavily forested, thick
vegetation, untamed wilds.  Brook, shallow clay, very deep soil,
aquifer, flux stone.  Default embark.  Tiristamal Rimteacher.
Designated for gathering several shrubs that look like cacao trees,
and designated a pile amongst them for cacao pod plants.
Designated trees around the wagon for cutting.  Told the jeweler to
grow, mill, brew, gather plants and process them, cook, press, and
work with wax (to eventually craft the couverture).  One brown (light
yellow) cacao tree in the cacao pod plant stockpile.  Told the
stoneworker to cut trees.  Built fishery to get some food.  Built
carpenter's workshop for barrels.  Built still to make cacahautl.
Two barrels in the cacao pod stockpile.  Created stockpile for
cacahautl, and another for cacao seeds.  Set still to brew a drink and
extract from a plant.  Tried to brew a plump helmet (no barrels), and
failed to extract (no extract-bearing plants).  Repeat brew.
With no stone, how will I make a quern, to mill the seeds?  Sounds
like I need to embark somewhere without an aquifer.  Abandon.

Tropical coniferous forest, hot, heavily forested, thick vegetation,
calm.  City, stream, clay, deep soil, deep metal, flux stone.  Default
embark.  Rulushnomal Splashstaves.  Designated a tree-cutting area.
Any shrubs that look like cacao trees not highlighted are cacao pods,
so designate them for gathering.  Designate some mining to get stone
and set up an inside for the bookkeeper's chair.  Built a fishery for
a local food supply.  Built a carpenter's workshop for barrels and
chairs.  Built a mason’s workshop for quern, and a mechanic for screw
press.  Designated pile for cacao pods.  Built four farm plots for
growing cacao pods.  Built still for cacahautl and failure to extract.
Designated pile for cacao seeds, and another for cacahautl.  Reserved
5 barrels for drinks.  Built jeweler since there are a few rough gems.
Added two chairs and repeating beds to the carpenter.  Built quern and
screw press.  Designated separate piles for cacao sugar (milled
plant), cocoa mass (paste), cocoa solids (pressed material), cocoa
butter (plant extract), cocoa liquor (plant extract), and finally fat,
to hold every kind of couverture from the Couverture (stable sweet
fat) workshop.  (Need to replace the bucket in the workshop with a
quern-like o.) Built a crafter for the jeweler (told to do waxwork) to
craft the couverture.  Told the fish cleaner to press, cook, process
plants, brew, mill, and grow.  Quern processed cacao pod [2], with a
bag, into 2 cacao sugar, and there's a cacao sugar bag in its pile.
Also a cacao seed bag in its pile.  Kitchen also says 5 cacao seeds.
Need to set up trade depot or we'll run out of bags.  Construct
mechanisms and blocks for the drawbridge.  Also told fish cleaner to
gather plants, since the cacao pod stockpile is empty.  Milled cacao
seeds to cocoa mass, which ended up in its stockpile.  Got a barrel
for the cacao pod stockpile.  Built a kitchen to see what it looks
like when the cookable stuff ends up in a meal.  Three cocoa mass, but
nothing pressed yet.  Two barrels for cacao pods, one for seeds.  2
cacao seeds and 3 cacao nibs, according to kitchen.  Set farm plots to
grow cacao pods year-round.  Why no pressing?  Low-priority job?
No job queued for screw press.  No PRESS_LIQUID_MAT references I
missed.  Maybe all the barrels are reserved?  Told carpenter to stop
making anything but barrels.  Make chocolate crafts doesn’t show up in
crafter’s workshop.  Got a cacahautl barrel, and another for cocoa mass.
Kitchen says 3 cacao seeds, 10 cacahautl, 2 cacao sugar, and 5 cacao nibs.
Turned off brewing for a while, to do something else with plants, and
since we have plenty of drink.  Designated the keep, since the water
is drying up, and told the mason to make 2 floodgates and a grate.
Levers in barracks.  Told the jeweler to also press, since no crafts
to be done.  Out of cacao seeds, so can't make paste or plant, but 8
cacao nibs: maybe I need to name these things the same.  Got a barrel
for each remaining stockpile.

Large world Minbazsil.  TMBF warm heavily-forested thick-veg calm.
Brook clay deep-soil deep-metal flux-stone.  Default embark to
Inethribar Cityhomage.  What skills to build CMW?  Wax work, cook.

Still, Drink (cacahautl), Plant extract (cocoa liquor).  Cacao pods;
cacao seeds; barrels, buckets, boxes and bags, bins.  [Quern], [screw
press], Milled plant (cacao sugar), Paste (cacao mass), Pressed
material (cacao solids), Plant extract (cocoa butter), CMW, fat and
couverture (tallow too).  Crafter, coverture crafts.

Kitchen shows 5 cacahautl, 4 cacao pod, 2 cacao seeds.

30?  cacahautl (stop brewing cacao pods), 7 cacao seeds (start
planting), no cacao pods.

19 cacahautl, 2 cacao pods, 6 cacao seeds.

Set idle fish cleaner to mill and press.  Kitchen says 1 cacao seed, 1
cacao sugar, 19 cacahautl, 1 cacao pod, 5 cacao seeds.  Stocks says
plants (cacao pod), powder (cacao sugar), drinks (19 cacahautl), glob
(cocoa mass), seeds (8 cacao seeds) in individual-item mode (as
opposed to type mode).  Aha!  In kitchen, cocoa mass is listed under
cacao seed type (separate from cacao seeds type), so cacao nibs was
making a useful distinction, if it wasn't preventing pressing the
mass.  Don't bother to mill cacao pods until we need the sugar to make
couverture.  Well, we'll need one sugar to one mass-product, so it
actually does make sense to keep pace, and it makes seeds, good for
farming and the paste.

Kitchen: 2 cacao seed, 2 cacao sugar, 19 cacahautl, 6 cacao seeds.
Glob stocks says the two cacao-seed-type items are cocoa mass.

Told mechanic to stop working on making mechanisms, to actually build
the screw press.  Stop milling, to focus on pressing.  4 cocoa mass
and 2 rock nut paste in glob stocks.  If there's a difference that
causes rock nut paste to press but cocoa mass to not press, we'll see
it here.  First need to get someone to the press.  Aha!  we need jugs
as well.  The stonecrafter can build one, so let's add a crafter near
the couverture stockpile.  Now that I've got two jugs I can schedule
the job "Press liquid from paste".  Cocoa mass and rock jug made cocoa
solids and apparently cocoa butter.

Kitchen says 4 cacao seed (nib), 3 cocoa butter, 2 cacao sugar, 16
cacahautl and 3 cacao pod.  Stocks says 3 cacao pod (plants), 2 cacao
sugar (powder), 16 cacahautl (drinks), 3 cocoa butter (liquid) in
cocoa butter plant-extract pile, 4 cacao seed [nib] (glob), and 8
cacao seeds (seeds).  Built kitchen to test reaction (got rid of
CMW).
