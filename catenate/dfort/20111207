nb reserve barrel bin
"Reserved Barrels/Bins" is a global setting that reserves a certain
number of barrels or bins, preventing them from being claimed by a
stockpile until they are filled by a Workshop that requires their use.
This feature is most often used to ensure that a fortress has ample
empty barrels for the production of alcohol, although empty barrels
are also necessary for other jobs.  You can change this setting in the
stockpile menu p.  If there are 5 reserved barrels, no stockpile will
claim an empty barrel until you have at least 6 lying around.  In this
way you can ensure that jobs like making alcohol always have free
barrels available.
