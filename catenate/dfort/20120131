Tonguepainted continued.  Looking for couverture, and chocolate
crafts.

Kitchen: 5 cacahautl (default cook, as other alcohols), 8 cacao pod
(no brew, can’t cook), 4 cacao seeds (no cook).  Stocks: cacao pod
[4], 3 cacao pod (plants); cacahautl [5] (drinks), 2 cacao seeds
(seeds).

Turn off brew order to spend time milling and pressing and cooking.
Eventually need more bags from the caravan.

Added 1 cacao sugar bag to kitchen (turn off cook), as 1 cacao sugar
(powder) in stocks.  Got 1 or 2 seeds from this mill.

Added 1 cacao nib to kitchen (turn off cook), as 1 cocoa mass (cacao
nib type) in stocks (glob).

Kitchen: 5 cacao seeds, 11 cacao pod, 4 cacahautl, 2 cacao sugar,
cacao nib.  Stocks: cacao pod [4], 3 cacao pod [2], cacao pod
(plants); 2 cacao sugar (powder); cacahautl [4] (drinks); cocoa mass
(glob); 5 cacao seeds (seeds).

No more bags to mill plants.  To get more seeds we’ll have to brew.

Kitchen: 11 cacao seeds, 6 cacao pod, 4 cacahautl, 7 cacao sugar,
3 cacao nib.  Stocks: 3 cacao pod [2] (plants); cacao sugar [4],
3 cacao sugar (powder); cacahautl [4] (drinks); 3 cocoa mass (glob);
11 cacao seeds (seeds).

Kitchen: 6 cacao pod, 4 cacahautl, 7 cacao sugar, 14 cacao nib.
Stocks: 3 cacao pod [2] (plants); cacao sugar [4], 3 cacao sugar
(powder); cacahautl [4] (drinks); 14 cocoa mass (glob).

Forgot to make rock jugs to hold cocoa butter.  Turn on screw press,
for as many liquid containers as we have.

Kitchen: 6 cacao pod, 3 cacahautl, 7 cacao sugar, 3 cocoa butter, 14
cacao nib.  Stocks: 3 cacao pod [2] (plants); cacao sugar [4], 3 cacao
sugar (powder); cacahautl [3] (drinks); 3 cocoa butter (liquid);
11 cocoa mass, 3 cocoa solid (glob).

Should have enough for couverture: only cocoa butter.  Reaction active
and scheduled!  Brought three cocoa butter jugs to kitchen.

Kitchen: 6 cacao pod, 2 cacahautl, 7 cacao sugar, 14 cacao nib.
Stocks: 3 cacao pod [2] (plants); cacao sugar [4], 3 cacao sugar
(powder); cacahautl [2] (drinks); 11 cocoa mass, 3 cocoa solid (glob).

Kitchen building contains 3 cocoa butter couverture (yay!), which
don’t appear in kitchen or stocks (boo!).  Should be in with fat (glob).
Both couverture templates have stockpile glob, and all three kinds of
edible.

Looks like I can recycle jugs for more cocoa butter.

Need to add sugar to reaction, then cocoa solid.

Can I craft the cocoa butter couverture?  Reaction not active.  Asks
for COUVERTURE_CRAFT glob, which we have none of, apparently.
Should I add the SOAP and SOAP_LEVEL tags?

Post now, to ask questions?  Or wait till I have the couverture worked out.
Add sugar, then solid, to know which breaks it.

Woo hoo!  The 3 bars of cocoa butter couverture are listed in stocks
(bars), but should probably be GLOB instead to store in glob stockpile.
