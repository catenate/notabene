Outpost Channeldells, Granite 252, Zulban Hatchedfolded

Suggested Sibrek Oiledtreaty keep records, since there don’t appear
many fish to clean.  Called ourselves a militia, the Creative Release,
since we have some ground to defend.  But suspending the order since
it’s us this month, and we need to get digging.  Tekkud Singledink,
the militia commander, and I are digging out the gems first to give
Stinthäd Basementclearing something to do.  Also laid out an area to
toss our refuse, and a grazing area for the livestock.  Set the idle
to cutting trees and gathering plants.

Built fishery, carpenter, trade depot, and a chair for Sibrek.  Laid
out kennel, mason, mechanic, and jeweler.  Set up outside farms
(planted cacao pod and wild strawberries) in a wallable area, with
still, kitchen, and farmer’s workshop, and piles for outside seeds,
plants, raw foods, and edible foods.
