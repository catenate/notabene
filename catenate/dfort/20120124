Plant gathering at a living cacao tree, a deep-tropical evergreen gets
a cacao pod.  Farmer's workshop plant-processes to get an inedible
cacao seed and inedible cacao pulp.  Still extracts (ferment, dry,
clean, roast, and shell) cacao seeds into inedible cacao nibs, and
cacao pulp into cacao sugar.  Brew cacao sugar into cacao alcohol.
Mill or quern grinds cacao nibs into inedible cocoa mass (cooking
ingredient).  Brew cacao mass (and optionally vanilla, chile pepper,
achiote, or cinnamon) into edible cacao water (drink).  Brew cacao
mass into inedible chocolate liquor (drink; cooking and brewing
ingredient).  Screw press chocolate liquor into cocoa solids and cocoa
butter.

Chocolate melanger work basically in a still/kitchen/farmer's workshop, 
with a heat-absorbing stone slab, and a double-broiler over a
regulatable heat source.  Conche and temper cocoa liquor, cocoa
solids, and cocoa butter or $animal fat into inedible “bitter
chocolate couverture” (cooking ingredient) or “bitter $animal
couverture” (with notes of $animal fat; cooking ingredient) . Conche
and temper cocoa liquor, cocoa butter or $animal fat, and cacao/
dwarven sugar into edible sweet chocolate/$animal couverture.  Conche
and temper cocoa solids, cocoa butter or $animal fat, and cacao or
dwarven sugar into edible dark chocolate/$animal couverture.  Conche
and temper cocoa liquor, milk, and cacao/dwarven sugar into edible
milk chocolate couverture.  Blend cocoa butter, cacao or dwarven
sugar, and milk into edible white chocolate couverture (not a cooking
ingredient).

Brew bitter/sweet/milk/white chocolate and milk into edible
chocolate milk.  Brew bitter/sweet/milk/white chocolate into
edible hot chocolate.

Eating edible chocolate products tantrums and gives a dwarf a happy thought.

Chocolate crafters (chocolatier) can mold bitter/sweet/milk/white
chocolate chocolate couverture into bars or other shapes (like an
engraving or cloth decoration), which is named “chocolate $object”.

Have to be a shrub rather than a tree, since trees can't have seeds.
Evergreen, so grows year-round.

Hamlet Emallikot, Slate 252, Reg Voiceguild

Our hamlet received around two dozen migrants, from 18 dwarves to 41.
We need to build a bowyer’s workshop for three migrants: novice Cog
Fellsilvers, who dresses wounds and will join the hospital staff and
squad; talented Mebzuth Glazeattacks, who designs buildings; and high
master Tulon Craterpapers, who also grows and presses plants, and also
knows architecture.

Zasit Moonarrows joins us as a dedicated woodcutter.  Nil Tourearth
the engraver became our first manager, with a chair in the dormitory.
Ber Breedstaves, animal caretaker, seconds diagnoses and serves on
the hospital squad.  Goden Mirrorpattern sutures and serve on the
hospital squad when he isn't training animals, making lye, or dissecting fish.
I expect Ber and Goden to try to keep their animals away from Zuntîr
Smithbridge, who dissects them, and whom I asked to butcher.
Zulban Shotshrine will be a more likely source of animals, as our high
master hunter, fish dissector, and competent bowyer.  (This hamlet
will not lack for crossbows!  We should probably set up four workshops
and sell what we don’t use.)

Logem Razormerged smelts, fishes, and crafts stone.  Libash Blockshot
crafts metal, gathers plants, cleans fish, and also cares for animals.
Goden Heldmine can work stone—her charcoal rubbings showed skill.
Zuntîr and Ber say she has more talent as a weaponsmith.  Whether
she’s good or not, she’s welcome—we have bars backing up and an anvil
waiting for a forge.  Erush Rackoars can weave as long as we have dyed
thread for her.  Ïngiz Cryptnets, another diagnostician for the
hospital squad, makes mechanisms; fishes, cleans, and dissects; and
processes plants.  Dodók Savedroofs is similarly fishy, and dresses
wounds as a member of the hospital staff.  Doren Bannerrouts fishes
and cooks.  She can also tell the value of goods, which will come in
handy if something happens to Ineth.  In the meantime she’ll keep
records (in the other dorm chair, with medium precision), since nobody
here is good at that, and appraising is a start.  She also seems a
good choice for militia captain.

Rîsen Tinabbeys milks our pastured water buffalo and cow, and the yak
cow they brought.  We also acquired a pet poult (so much for its meat),
pet turkey gobbler, horse foal, chick, cow calf, 2 mule foals, pet
duckling, ram, pet cavy pup, and a bull calf.  This adds to our
current 3 horses, sow, and boar (expecting piglets someday).

Kadol Fieldcrystals makes the most of our farm plots, and smiths metal
(he can also swim).  Atír Basementmarket makes potash and dyes
(the dwarf will die if he wastes too much of his time making potash).
Dakost Drumcraft spins wool into yarn, and hair into thread, at the
workshop we set up by the farms.  Aban Championbridged, our fifth
bowyer, also weaves, acquires and shapes wood, and tans.
Kikrost Feedceilings makes our fourth diagnoser, and probably won’t
make the hospital squad.  And Kikrost Whispersmirrored, bloody peasant
with some fighting skills, makes 24 immigrants.  Probably three new
squads, and we don’t have a second barracks yet, for the six new
recruits training at once.  Maybe breach the upper caverns and set up
a walled-off barracks?

Expanded the hospital squad to 9.  This minimizes the number of
hospital recruits training as reserve defense.  Asked expert marks-
dwarf Zulban to lead the archer squad, though still not enough
marksdwarves to activate it.

Two new squads: Silvery Bluenesses, led by Kikrost Whispersmirrored,
an adequate speardwarf.  Goden Heldmine, a novice axedwarf, heads the
Diamond Gulfs.  This leaves two dwarves (Tulon Craterpapers and Rîsen
Tinabbeys) not in a squad, for the next wave of migrants.  Five squads
active in the only barracks, which should be tolerable.
