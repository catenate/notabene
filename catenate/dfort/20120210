Outpost Standardfangs, 251 Felsite, Stodir Syrupglazed

Planned a farm area on 148, and a keep spanning 142–140 (dining,
hospital, cellar) around the barracks on 141.  Nobody’s done a thing
yet with the cacao seeds.  Low on plants, fish, out of meat.  A good
number of prepared meals for the seven of us, but not if there are too
many migrants.
