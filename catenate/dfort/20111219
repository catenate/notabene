I have a central waterfall going thru the center of a 3x3 
staircase, with the middle replaced with iron grates all 
the way down.  The waterfall ends below my deepest 
sleeping layer (usually 15 or so), and enters a system of 
sewers and cisterns below my hospital, before passing 
out the side of the map.

I generally turn on farming/process/milling/dying for ALL dwarves in
order to avoid rotten plants and materials.
