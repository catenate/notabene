Hey look kids, it's the intestine monster!  It squiggles and splats!
Beware its noxious vapors!  (Thanks to Dwarf Fortress, I grossed out
my wife.:)


nb chocolate mod test
Created a new world, Mon Xestsu, to test glazing with chocolate in the kitchen.
TMBF, warm, heavy forest, thick veg, wilderness.  Brook, clay, some soil,
shallow metal.  Standard embark to Lorbamshis Standardfangs.

Set stoneworker to mine, fish cleaner to keep books, fish cleaner and
jeweler to press, cook, gather and process plants, brew, mill, and
grow.  Designate entry/craft and couverture industry areas, and gather
plants and cut trees.  Build fishery and carpenter¹ outside.
 ¹ Chairs, beds, barrels, bins, buckets.

Huge dry lake basin.  Several defensible large alcoves.
Tetrahedrite and marble in entry area.

Since there are no gems, but there is tetrahedrite and marble,
build wood burner and smelter next to mason¹ and mechanic.
Instead of cocoa liquor, pile other foods and (separately) drinks.
Store other-material crafts near crafter to store? chocolate
figurines, and 1x9 prepared meals near kitchen to cover? with
couverture and chocolate.
 ¹ Quern, 2 floodgates, wall grate, tables, doors, blocks, coffers,
cabinets.

Let miner handle craft area alone.

Activate quern.  Finished trade depot.  Kitchen has these couverture
reactions,¹ none active yet.
 ¹ Make couverture from fat (f)
Glaze food with couverture (F)
Make raw chocolate
Make bitter chocolate
Make white chocolate
Make sweet chocolate
Make dark chocolate
Make milk chocolate
Glaze food with chocolate (C)
 
Kitchen: 6 cacao pod.  Stocks: cacao pod [3], 3 cacao pod (plants).
No couverture reactions.

Build screw press.

Should probably set up an underground farm later, in soil, for the
30 seeds.¹  Starting to get seeds from outside plants, so find a
farming area somewhere defensible.  Clearing out ramps and trees
blocking the way of a wall to seal in a deep alcove on 146.
 ¹ Plump helmet, pig tail, dimple cup, cave wheat, sweet pod, rock nuts.

Set the craft-area crafter to churn out mugs.

For now, line up beds along the entrance.  First room to dig out in
the pod will be the dormitory.

Start still.  Can’t yet activate screw press.  No more milling until
some bags free up from planting seeds underground, in kitchen and
outside farm, and dyer.¹ Need to get some more in trade, or set up
loom and clothier to make bags.  Planting will free up bags, but
they’ll just be used again from brewing or milling.  So fullest solution
is trading for and producing bags, which means loom and clothier,
and an underground farm.
 ¹ In stocks, bags contain rock nuts, cave wheat seeds, plump helmet
spawn, pig tail seeds, sweet pod seeds, dimple cup spawn, Longland
grass seeds, hide root seeds, 2 Longland flour, and redroot dye.
Use these up with inside farms, followed by outside farms and kitchen,
then dyer.

Test for couverture and each type of chocolate; couverture and each
type of chocolate figurine; and couverture and each type of chocolate
covered prepared meal.  Test that trade with humans brings something
in the chocolate industry.  Already saw someone prefer cacao seeds,
generally.
