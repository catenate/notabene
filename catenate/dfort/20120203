If this all works then we need to do the same with a fat-based couverture.
First we need some fat, so capture a live land animal and slaughter it.
Make the hunter also a trapper, and carve a trap and cage.
Bah, just slaughter the water buffalo bull.¹
 ¹ Only need 1, which migrants might have.  No water buffalo cows yet.

Active “Make couverture from fat” task in kitchen takes cocoa solid,
water buffalo fat, and cacao sugar (in bag).  Darn it, turned just
into a glob.  Add reaction product¹ to FAT_TEMPLATE.
 ¹ [MATERIAL_REACTION_PRODUCT:COUVERTURE_MAT:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:COUVERTURE]

Reaction to make couverture from fat¹ is disabled.  We have 4 cocoa
solid and cacao sugar [2] in stocks.  There’s a sugar bag nearby,
so that's probably not it.  No other fats listed in glob, so maybe
that reaction ate the whole stack.  If so, butcher something else
(this gets expensive).
