nb craft dark stone short sword military trap obsidian stockpile
http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Update%201-5/

First, I cancel the craftsdwarves repetitive making of bone crafts,
and set them to making dark stone short swords.  These work just as
well as steel swords, and will be perfect for military or trap usage.
I also designate an obsidian stockpile nearby, so they have plenty of
material to work with.

[Better to eliminate crowded local wildlife with siege weapons
(ballista and catapult), to train their operators.  Miasma will blow
away outside.]

Our cage traps have already proven their worth, as they have captured
an entire raid of mandrills.  … The migrants lead the elephants right
into the cage traps I set up.  Six elephants captured.  … We've caught
a leopard.  This brings us up to 5 mandrills, 9 elephants, and one
leopard.  … Here's one half of the elephant/mandrill/whatever traps I
have set up.  I have channels blocking off one half of the map from
the other, so animals HAVE to go through these if they want to get
across.  … More invaders.  It's good to see our cage traps are still
functional.  Here they are after thwarting a troop of mandrills.  I am
a bit worried about the amount of animals we have already captured and
tamed.  Few seem to adopt them, except for the terrifying battle
scarred elephants.  The amount of stray animals running through the
halls has become a nuisance, but no one seems to have the knowledge or
will to geld any of them.  I foresee this to be a problem in the
future, but I cannot bring myself to slaughter any needlessly. … 
I oversaw a lot of cage management earlier.  They are becoming
exceedingly full, and the trappers are demanding more empty cages.
All stray elephants were transported to a single cage, and animal
trainers are working on taming the savage elephants, as well as the
mandrills.  I would like our mandrills to be chained up near sensitive
areas as a form of defense.  Although they cannot be trained as war
mandrills, they surely would attack some invaders, and serve as
psychological defense to weaken enemy morale.
	Apparently two stray elephants, one adult and one calf were
accidently released, and are now interrupting the workers jobs nearby.
The workers seem to be almost as disturbed by the beasts as I am, tame
or not.  At least they have stopped complaining about the lack of
traps.  I am unsure how to proceed in this situation.  Perhaps it is
time for my earlier catapult battery plans?  The area they seem to be
inhabiting densely populated, but I will begin construction of siege
parts and observe their movements.
	On the topic of the main work/storage area, I must complain
about the decision of previous rulers who placed it out in the open.
It is a horribly cluttered mass of barrels and shops, which are all
easily immobilized by a single problem, as proven by the stray
elephants.  As I write, the stray, supposedly TAME elephant appears to
have struck down a pet war dog who wandered too close.  It was
probably Ikudoltud, or "Reignedstalked" the rather large and
battlescarred mother of the calf.  I only hope that the siege workshop
isn't close enough to be interfered with by her, although I confess
that this place has proven too confusing for me to locate it myself.

nb construct stone block train mason workshop
If you're going to be doing a lot of construction with stone, a good
way to train a mason is to make a mason's workshop assigned to the
trainee with the workshop profile, have him/her churn out stone
blocks, and do construction with the blocks.  Not only does it train
masonry, but the blocks have greater value than the rough stone
they're made from, increasing the architectural created wealth of the
resulting constructions.

nb  custom seed stockpile barrel capacity cook
http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/Farm_plot#Management

Create a custom stockpile near your farm which will only accept seeds.
This will consolidate your seeds into one place, instead of having
them littered all through the dining room.  As a single barrel can
hold up to 10 seed bags (each of which can hold 100 seeds of a
specific type), this stockpile can be only three or four tiles.
Alternately, you can make a more traditional sized custom stockpile,
which only accepts seeds and bars of potash for fertilizing.  It may
also be a good idea to set aside a few seeds from each type of crop
and forbid them, as a seed bank in case of catastrophe.

You can also create a custom stockpile that will only accept plants,
to avoid having it all mixed up with your meat and drinks.  It would
be a good idea to have this stockpile near your still, farmer's
workshop, kitchen, etc.  If you suffer from plump helmet overflow,
create a plump-helmet-only stockpile, forbid plump helmets from all
other food stockpiles, and let the crops in the field die if they
can't be picked.  It is worth noting that withering crops in the field
do not produce miasma.

Use the stocks menu, and go to the Kitchen tab.  From here you can see
how many of each kind of food you have.  If you're running out of a
certain kind of seed, toggle the corresponding plant "Cook" setting to
red.  Cooking plants doesn't leave a seed.  If you have too many of a
certain kind of seed, toggle the seed "Cook" setting to blue.  Just
make sure you check on the stocks and toggle it back before you run
out, or use the seed bank idea above.


nb bin barrel bag
http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010:Using_bins_and_barrels

Ordinarily, each item or stack (e.g.  ≡Dwarven Ale Stew [59]≡) of
items occupies one space of stockpile room.  You can consolidate
stockpile space by building bins and barrels that can hold many items
at once.  Barrels store and preserve food and alcohol; bins can store
many types of smaller items, such as finished goods, metal bars, ammo,
or gems.  Building a steady supply of containers helps reduce the
space you need for storage.

One thing to note about storing seeds is that bags are required to put
seeds in.  These bags will then be placed inside the barrel.
Otherwise, the dwarves'll end up with one seed per tile—quite
inefficient!

nb under ground seed first year
In the first year, you may want to focus your production on berries
aboveground, or plump helmets underground, because they can be brewed
and eaten both raw or cooked.  Plump helmets are also one of the 2
fast growing plants (Pig tails being the other but they can only be
brewed, not eaten).  Quarry bushes, cave wheat and sweet pods require
processing before they can be eaten and take longer to grow.  Pig
tails and dimple cups can produce cloth and dye respectively, so grow
these later.  Dimple cups are the only underground crop that can
neither be brewed nor otherwise processed into food (except for its
seed, which can be cooked).  Consider processing and cooking (and
adjusted farming) as soon as possible since it adds quality levels to
your food and in the case of quarry bushes and sweet pods quintuples
the amount of food.  Also, if you want to cater for the preferences of
your dwarves, you will likely grow all types of crops sooner or later.

So now we’ve set a huge pile of junk for us to sell, lets pick a bunch

weapons (but not the very best ones) like steel crossbows, chainmail
(steel and iron), shields, etc.  But don’t stress, buy what amuses you!
Oh, definitely buy a few cloth or leather bags (what seeds get stored in)
and some rope (for setting up animals as guards).  Type of rope or
bags doesn’t really matter.¹

http://afteractionreporter.com/2009/02/23/the-complete-and-utter-newby-tutorial-for-dwarf-fortress-part-8-%E2%80%9Cits-a-trap/

Essentially what we’re going to do is turn some wood into charcoal (at
a wood furnace), then use the charcoal to turn metal ores into metal
bars (at a smelter), then we’re going to use more charcoal to smith
metal bars into items (at a metalsmith’s forge).  As you can no doubt
imagine the problem we will face is the charcoal bottleneck.  It will
take a lot of wood to fuel all our furnaces!  Most of the time this
problem is got around by players using magma smelters and magma
forges.  We haven’t struck magma yet, so we’re going to plough ahead
with the hard way, at least for a while.


nb noble room mandate
Nobles (from the “n” menu) generally want a bedroom (assigned from a
bed), a dining room (assigned from a table), an office (assigned from
a chair) and often a tomb as well (assigned from a coffin).  For
simplicty’s sake, set up each room in its own contained area and then
throw in some decorations to keep the noble happy, like armor stands,
weapon stands, containers, statues, cabinets, cages (with their
favourite animal in them), that sort of thing.  Usually nobles want at
least two of most of those items so produce a ton and get placing!

What is all this about nobles I hear you ask?  Well, once your
fortress gets to a certain size, those purple slacker dwarfs will come
to live in your fortress.  They usually don’t do much (other than haul
stuff) but they do make demands.  Their biggest demand is for rooms,
which need to be of a certain quality.  Quality can be increased
through smoothing and engraving the walls of the room as well as
adding more furniture, especially high quality furniture.

The other thing nobles do is make mandates.  Mandates are demands by
the noble for things to be done, like the production of certain goods,
or a ban on the export of certain goods.  It pays to try and meet the
demands of your nobles or they may go crazy and cause all kinds of
problems.


nb book keep clerk noble time setting
Next job for you is to assign a book keeper.  Usually, if you embark
with at least one dwarf with the “appraiser” skill (good idea, by the
way), this job would already be filled.  But for now it’s vacant.
This skill is what makes our stock count accurate (more on that
later).  Fortunately for us we can chose a dwarf to do the job.  They
might not be doing a good job at first (having no skill), but they
will learn, and they provide a useful function, accurate stocktaking!

So, in the nobles screen use the arrow keys to scroll down to
“Bookkeeper” and hit “enter”.  Find Eshtan and hit enter, assigning
him to this job.  The bookkeeper requires an office to work, just as
well we just assigned him one, right?

Next, with Bookkeeper still highlighted hit “s” for “settings” (the
only noble role you can assign settings for).  The screen you’ll see
now dictates how much time your dwarf will spend counting.  Use the
arrow to scroll to “Highest” and hit enter.  Eshtan will now work very
hard to get all our stock counts accurate!


nb cook brew permission
Cooking meat (ie, “cook” is blue) is fine.  Don’t cook spawn or seeds
(“cook” is red”) unless you have way, way too many.  All plants can be
brewed as brewing returns seeds.  Turn off cook for “Plump Helmet”,
you don’t want to cook them out of stock, right?  Cooking booze is
great as you end up magically creating more food than you started with.
Trust me on this (or look it up on the wiki).


nb use stone type permission forbid
In the stone menu you see (in red) all the stones your dwarfs are
forbidden to build with/use and in green, all the ones they are
allowed to use.  Scroll through with the arrows and hit enter over
every stone that does not have a use description appear on the right.
The only exception may be bauxite due to its special magma-proof
qualities.

The reason you are doing this is so that the dwarfs have much more
choice in the stone they will use to make doors, walls, etc etc.  This
stops them running half way across the map to get some boring stone
when a perfectly useful stone (that just happens to be yellow) is
sitting next to them, but ignored.


nb melt metal object weapon trap forbid
For example, you might find, after a goblin raid, that you’ve got a
ton of their crappy weapons lying around, what to do with them?  Well,
you could add them to weapons traps, or you could find them in the
stocks menu and hit “m” for “melt” when they are selected and then any
smelter with the “melt metal object” task on will have a dwarf grab
the item and then melt it back to a metal bar.

You can also use this menu to “forbid” items.  If you have a bunch of
low-quality junk you don’t want your dwarfs to use, hit “f” for
“Forbid” with the item highlighted and you’ll find they will ignore it.
This is handy when setting weapons and armor up for your military as
you can prevent them from picking up wooden swords and thus push them
to pick up your non-forbidden steel swords!
