Outpost Emallikot, Felsite 251, Reg Okoldomas

From a strange mood, our building designer Avuz Adildolil brought us
new plans for an overall layout of workshops, which we approved.
This works within our halls: slightly overlapping, open 11x11-urist
areas, with staircases in the four corners.

Around a wood pile we will have workshops for the carpenter, crafter,
bowyer, and wood burner, and piles for wood furniture, crafts, and
crossbows.  Between the wood area and the metal area we will store
charcoal, and bituminous coal and lignite if we find any.

Below the stone workshops we'll pile interesting stones, near doors
and hatches to the mines.  Around a magma-safe stone pile will be
workshops for the mason, jeweler, mechanic, and crafter, and piles for
stone furniture, encrusted furniture, mechanisms, and mugs.  (The mugs
don't really need to be magma-safe, but it's not worth setting up a
stone feed to an isolated craftsdwarf.  We can set up crafters in
areas where the magma-safe stones are gone.) Between two staircases
we'll put cut gems.

From the charcoal between two staircases we'll locate three smelters,
then three bar piles, then three forges.  Dedicate one smelter, bar
pile, and forge to weapons, armor, trap components, and ammunition of
weapons-grade metal other than iron and steel.  Another for iron and
steel.  The last for forge-crafting other metals, except adamantine.
The remaining margins fill with weapons and trap components, armor,
and ammunition and crafts.

Adamantine will have its own workshop area down by the magma, using
microcline as our building material.  Around a pile of fuel we'll arrange
a crafter, two smelters, and a forge, and piles for adamanite threads,
wafers, wafers again, and weapons.  In three margins we'll store armor,
and the fourth the raw adamantine for which we praise the miners.

We'll make clothes and soap in the same area.  Around a pile of cloth,
the loom for the weaver, workshops for the dyer and clothier, and a
pile of clothes, with thread and dye in the margins.  Fill out the
remainder with a pile of ash, the ashery, a pile of lye, and the
soapmaker, with tallow and oil in the margin.

We'll have to leave a wall around corpses and the butcher.
(A pile for skins would delay them getting to the tanner.)
Outside the miasma-room we can put the tanner, a leather pile of
tanned hides, the leather worker, and a pile of leather goods.

Also together will be glass and ceramics.  In the middle a pile of
bags, between two piles of fuel.  To one side, sand bags, a glass
furnace, and a pile of glass, with pearlash and rock crystal in the
margin.  To the other side, clay, a kiln, and ceramics, with ash and
cassiterite in the margin.

In a farm area, we'll have space for two 7-urist furrows for each of
the four undergroud-plant arrangements (pig tails, and plump helmets
in the off-season; cave wheat and dimple cups; sweet pods and plump
helmets; and quarry bush and dimple cups).  A furrow-sized pile of
seeds, and another of plants, between the two farm plot sets.  Farmer,
kitchen, still, quern and screw press.  Raw food pile in one remaining
margin, and edible food pile in the other.

Near the trade depot, three craft lanes.  A pile of bone, horn, hoof,
and skull for the bone carver, and a pile for her bone bolts and crafts.
A pile of wood for a wood crafter, and a pile for his crafts.
And a pile of non-magma-safe stone for the stone crafter, and a pile
for her mugs.

Nest boxes in the pasture for the livestock.  Hives near entrance.

nb false entrance trap siege water trap
Create a false entrance to a deep stairwell with lever-linked hatches
every 10 levels, or just one drawbridge at the exit.  Allow invading
force to path in and go deep in the pipe, then shut the drawbridge
behind them, or the hatches to separate them.  Leave them alone until
they starve to death, or drown them, or send in a squad to mop them up piecewise.

Create a false entrance to a room whose floor is (mostly?) a lever-
linked bridge.  Shut the door to the room when most of the invasion
force has assembled, which also retracts the bridge and drops them a
large number of levels to their death, or for any that survive to be
training for the military.

Create a false entrance to the fortress, which leads to a room with
three exits.
	The first exit is a wall drawbridge which leads back outside.
The second exit is a hole in the ceiling, which leads to a floodgate
which leads to a tunnel filled with water which wants to get into the
room (eg, a brook's flow from a higher level).  The third exit is a
grated hole in the floor which leads down to a wall drawbridge which
leads to a flow of water away from the room (eg, any open passage
leading outside, and eventually to water or the edge of the map).
	One lever shuts the first wall drawbridge (installed open),
opens the hidden (except to flyers) floodgate (installed closed), and
shuts the second drawbridge (installed open).  The water enters and
has nowhere to go, so fills the room and drowns the invaders.
Resetting the lever opens the death chamber for the next set of
invaders, closes the floodgate, and drains the water (which inundates
any invaders coming in from the outflow, if the outflow is not
directly to water).
	If a troll smashes up the first wall drawbridge, then they can
get out.  If a flyer smashes up the floodgate, the invasion force gets
inundated more quickly, and the room needs to be recovered by closing
a floodgate closer to the water supply, if the room does not have
enough drainage to reduce the water to construction depth.  If a troll
smashes up the floor grate, then the possessions and corpses can leave
the room with the draining waterâ€™s flow.  If a troll jumps down and
smashes up the second wall drawbridge, then they might not drown.
