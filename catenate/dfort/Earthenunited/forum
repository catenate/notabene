The Diaries of Earthenunited

For my first fort in a while, I’m keeping meticulous notes, grouped by
month from the beginning of the fortress, in the forms of diaries and
ledgers with only a little characterization.  These are not proper,
coherent stories, and are not summarized and digested as such,
but stories do of course emerge from the entries.

I currently capture these perspectives: expedition (leader), military
commander (milcom), bookkeeper (ledger), and others (diary).
I keep lists of (artifacts), dwarves (cast), what I brought on (embark),
and interpretations of (engravings).  The key to the fort, which started
with a (shelter), is its (layout), which is guided by translations of
(fragments) of an ancient dwarven mountainhome-building guide
(or possibly a travel brochure).

These might be of interest to someone who wants to follow along more
closely (than a story with demands of plot and pacing) as someone
plans, lays out, and maintains a fortress.  The fortress layout might
also be interesting: I’m trying to create a network of highly compact
and efficient burrows, each isolated from each other by mines and
drawbridges, where each burrow controls which others it trusts from
those to which it connects.  I haven’t really seen this style: people
tend to build big sprawling floor plans (with a broad central staircase
used past the first delve) that makes it difficult to contain the loss
of part of the fort.

I store the files in this github repository, including a recent copy
of the region directory, if you want to take a look.

I currently update several times a week, as I find time for vanilla DF 0.34.11.
I do intend to try this style again with the new release, whenever it comes out.
I expect that I will have to alter the outer walls to handle jumpers and climbers,
at least.

(order) is obsolete, since I use the diaries instead, and (notes) unused.
