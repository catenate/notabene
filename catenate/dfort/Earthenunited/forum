The Diaries of Earthenunited

For my first fort in a while, Iâ€™m keeping meticulous notes, grouped by
month from the beginning of the fortress, in the forms of diaries and
ledgers with only a little characterization.  These are not proper,
coherent stories, and are not summarized and digested as such,
but stories do of course emerge from the entries.

These might be of interest to someone who wants to follow along
more closely (than a story with demands of plot and pacing) as
someone plans, lays out, and implements a fortress.  I currently
update several times a week, as I find time to play vanilla DF 0.34.11.

I store the files in this github repository:
https://github.com/catenate/notabene/tree/master/catenate/dfort/Earthenunited

I currently capture these perspectives: expedition (leader), military
commander (milcom), bookkeeper (ledger), and others (diary).
I keep lists of (artifacts), dwarves (cast), what I brought on (embark),
and interpretations of (engravings).  The key to the fort, which started
with a (shelter), is its (layout), which is guided by translations of
(fragments) of an ancient dwarven mountainhome-building guide
(or possibly a travel brochure).

(order) is obsolete, since I use the diaries instead, and (notes) unused.
