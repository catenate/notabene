nb diary 253 spring

Shorast: 1 Granite.  The Folded Banner stopped aside two other wagons.
Whatever happened to both of them left their animals as skeletons, and
scattered a few of their belongings.  No sign of their bodies, either
dead for burial, or live to take back in chains for deriliction of duty.
	They barely started to dig out an all-pile below an embark shelter,
and stairs down a water tunnel and cistern.  The simple plans seem sound,
from what we can tell, and there are no unusual fissures or echoes
from the stone, so we’ll continue to set up the embark shelter.
	I'll start the books now, to know what we can trade before winter.
Probably mechanisms, to control the many drawbridges that isolate cells.
The first layer of the embark shelter will be trade, food, and capentry.
The second will be a general stockpile, to unload the wagon(s), and
the third will be for the miner, mason, mechanic, and metalsmith.
