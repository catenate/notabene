Diary of Ïngiz Diamondfolded, first-migrant planter, The Folded Banner.

253 Sandstone.  Knighthold the Velvet Slaughter, an undead two-hump
camel skeleton, or the ensuing panic, killed Rakust, Eshtân, Zasit,
Deler, Ilral, and Shorast, as well as a water buffalo calf, turkey gobbler,
three stray dogs, and the dog Åmdoren.  Erush, Tun, and Ïteb are missing,
presumed dead.  Our new expedition leader, Ber Paintsqueezed,
is unconscious but unharmed, and Mebzuth is pale and damaged.
No medical talent or hospital burrow, so Mebzuth may not survive.
15 drink of 334 total food, for 6 dwarves and 22 animals.
Need to assess remaining talent and reassign work.
	Stonedwarf Edëm can mine and craft rock pots and mugs, and
will have to be our mason (we need coffins), mechanic, and jeweler.
Èrith can cut wood and do carpentry, burn wood and smelt ore.
If Ber wakes, will have to do something more useful than tan or weave:
probably broker, and help out Edëm with mechanisms and cutting gems.
If Mebzuth recovers, she can broker, and maybe light work at the fishery.
Vabôk can farm, fish, butcher, and tan.  I can farm, cook, and dye.
