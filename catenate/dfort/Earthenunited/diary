Diary of Shorast Coloredmined, embark expedition leader, The Folded Banner.

253 Granite.  The Folded Banner stopped aside two other wagons. 
Whatever happened to both of them left their animals as skeletons,
and scattered a few of their belongings.  No sign of their bodies,
either dead for burial, or live to take back in chains for deriliction
of duty.
	They barely started to dig out an all-pile below an embark shelter,
and stairs down a water tunnel and cistern.  The simple plans seem sound,
from what we can tell, and there are no unusual fissures or echoes
from the stone, so we’ll continue to set up the embark shelter.
	I’ll start the books now, to know what we can trade before winter.
Probably mechanisms, to control the many drawbridges that isolate cells.
The first layer of the embark shelter will be trade, food, and capentry.
The second will be a general stockpile, to unload the wagon(s), and
the third will be for the stonedwarves.
	Laid out a general store for shelter: seven lines of food and sundries,
two for a hospital, four for defense.  Let the other wagons be collected,
as the miners dig out the water tunnel, small cistern, stonedwarves cell,
and farm cell, all stacked in our embark shelter.

Slate.  Hollowed three levels of shelter burrow.  Started building
workshops and producing items.  4 plots and kitchen, still, farmer’s;
carpenter’s; trade depot; jeweler’s, mason’s, mechanic’s; crafter’s;
wood furnace, smelter, and forge.  Rock mugs for trade.  A small
meeting hall and dining room by the outsiders, and a small dormitory
by the stonedwarves.  Top priority is cistern and well before winter.

Felsite.  Finished meeting hall and dining room.  Ran out of ordinary
rock, so mined a frame, found rough red zircon.  Told miner/mason
Eshtân Auraquakes to cut gems, and woodworker/carpenter Èrith
Shieldbelts to make charcoal and smelt ore.

Hematite summer.  Migrants to relieve Eshtân as mason and jeweler,
and Zasit as fisherdwarf and fish cleaner.  Overall, a stoneworker,
a gem cutter, two farmers, a fishery worker, a tanner, a wood crafter,
and a glazer.  Set up a fishery by the river.  108 food.

Malachite.  Mining galena hematite¸ and native copper.  71 drink of
164 total food, for 15 dwarves and 19 animals.  Exported 0 of 9,486
created wealth.

Galena.  Responded to report of a kobold thief from Strugufusrulgin.
Rakust Pulleydriven is a competent swordsdwarf, so became military
commander and leader of the Walled Systems, and chased off the
unwelcome intruder.  Also encountered an animated remnant of the first
two embarks, a two-humped camel skeleton, which interrupted work,
and killed Rakust sent to dispatch it.  Returned Eshtân to masonry and
stone detailing, to make a coffin for Rakust.  The hallowed hematite
vein is the toll of our angers, the red-ghost-disperse Angngotololum.

Limestone.  Camel still disruptive.  Built six nest boxes for poultry.

Sandstone.  Finally cleared the path to the well.  Skeleton starting
to kill dogs, so I will lead a citizen’s-militia squad to kill it.

253 Sandstone.  Knighthold the Velvet Slaughter, an undead two-hump
camel skeleton, or the ensuing panic, killed Rakust, Eshtân, Zasit,
Deler, Ilral, and Shorast, as well as a water buffalo calf, turkey gobbler,
three stray dogs, and the dog Åmdoren.  Erush, Tun, and Ïteb are missing,
presumed dead.  Our new expedition leader, Ber Paintsqueezed,
is unconscious but unharmed, and Mebzuth is pale and damaged.
No medical talent or hospital cell, so Mebzuth may not survive.
15 drink of 334 total food, for 6 dwarves and 22 animals.
Need to assess remaining talent and reassign work.
	Stonedwarf Edëm can mine and craft rock pots and mugs, and
will have to be our mason (we need coffins), mechanic, and jeweler.
Èrith can cut wood and do carpentry, burn wood and smelt ore.
If Ber wakes, will have to do something more useful than tan or weave:
probably broker, and help out Edëm with mechanisms and cutting gems.
If Mebzuth recovers, she can broker, and maybe light work at the fishery.
Vabôk can farm, fish, butcher, and tan.  I can farm, cook, and dye.


Diary of Ber Paintsqueezed, first-migrant expedition leader,
The Folded Banner.

253 Sandstone.  The fighting isn’t over, and the poultry are taking
the brunt of it.  Disgusting purple clouds of rot—let our refuse clutter
the green grass!  Found Mebzuth dead, no ghosts yet.  11 drink of
307 food, for 5 dwarves and 22 animals.  Rebuilding trade depot,
still, and farmer’s workshop.

Timber.  Èrith is melancholy.  Ïngiz is berserk.  Migrants: two soldiers
(which we dearly need), woodcrafter, and animal trainer.  Kulet will
command militia and squad of other military migrants, now only Sarvesh.
Need to establish barracks, probably at end of copper vein.
Kulet couldn’t handle the hostility around here.  No trade caravan.
Vabôk will also gather plants and brew: we have 8 drink of 226 food
for 7 dwarves and 23 animals.


Diary of Vabôk Flukecobalt, first-migrant expedition leader,
The Folded Banner.

253 Timber.  Rakust was the first to die, my wife rotting in front of me;
since then I revel in this chaos and disorder.  Edëm went berserk and
killed Ber with his pick.  The Mountainhome diplomat left unhappy,
no trade.  Edëm killed Ïngiz, so that’s sorted.  Ber killed Kulet, and
Edëm killed Sarvesh, so no need for barracks.  7 drink of 225 food for
4 dwarves and 23 animals.  More miasma.  The merchants’ hammerdwarf
and the marksdwarf Ùshrir ftook down vomiting and retching Edëm with
gut shots.  Got a still working, to drink as we die and rot.

Moonstone.  30–40–48 drink of 323–333–328 food, for 4 dwarves and
23 animals.  The merchants have been watching us fall apart, and are
leaving soon, as we’ve been unable to set up and staff a trade depot.
Partly my fault I guess, I just found the plans.  General orders to
gather plants, farm, brew, and cook, to keep us alive a while.
Ùshrir wil keep books and broker.  Èrith slipped away.
