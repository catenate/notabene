We build in mine, bridge, chamber tradition.  A network of [draw?]
bridge-walled halls connected by tunnels of ore and jewel clusters.
The hallowed hematite vein is the toll of (our) angers, where we lay
to rest our angry undead.


Diary of Shorast Coloredmined, embark expedition leader, The Folded Banner.

253 Granite.  The Folded Banner stopped aside two other wagons. 
Whatever happened to both of them left their animals as skeletons,
and scattered a few of their belongings.  No sign of their bodies,
either dead for burial, or live to take back in chains for deriliction
of duty.
	They barely started to dig out an all-pile below an embark shelter,
and stairs down a water tunnel and cistern.  The simple plans seem sound,
from what we can tell, and there are no unusual fissures or echoes
from the stone, so we’ll continue to set up the embark shelter.
	I’ll start the books now, to know what we can trade before winter.
Probably mechanisms, to control the many drawbridges that isolate burrows.
The first layer of the embark shelter will be trade, food, and capentry.
The second will be a general stockpile, to unload the wagon(s), and
the third will be for the stonedwarves.
	Laid out a general store for shelter: seven lines of food and sundries,
two for a hospital, four for defense.  Let the other wagons be collected,
as the miners dig out the water tunnel, small cistern, stonedwarves burrow,
and farm burrow, all stacked in our embark shelter.

Slate.  Hollowed three levels of shelter burrow.  Started building
workshops and producing items.  4 plots and kitchen, still, farmer’s;
carpenter’s; trade depot; jeweler’s, mason’s, mechanic’s; crafter’s;
wood furnace, smelter, and forge.  Rock mugs for trade.  A small
meeting hall and dining room by the outsiders, and a small dormitory
by the stonedwarves.  Top priority is cistern and well before winter.

Felsite.  Finished meeting hall and dining room.  Ran out of ordinary
rock, so mined a frame, found rough red zircon.  Told miner/mason
Eshtân Auraquakes to cut gems, and woodworker/carpenter Èrith
Shieldbelts to make charcoal and smelt ore.

Hematite summer.  Migrants to relieve Eshtân as mason and jeweler,
and Zasit as fisherdwarf and fish cleaner.  Overall, a stoneworker,
a gem cutter, two farmers, a fishery worker, a tanner, a wood crafter,
and a glazer.  Set up a fishery by the river.  108 food.

Malachite.  Mining galena hematite¸ and native copper.  71 drink of
164 total food, for 15 dwarves and 19 animals.  Exported 0 of 9,486
created wealth.

Galena.  Responded to report of a kobold thief from Strugufusrulgin.
Rakust Pulleydriven is a competent swordsdwarf, so became military
commander and leader of the Walled Systems, and chased off the
unwelcome intruder.  Also encountered an animated remnant of the first
two embarks, a two-humped camel skeleton, which interrupted work,
and killed Rakust sent to dispatch it.  Returned Eshtân to masonry and
stone detailing, to make a coffin for Rakust.

Limestone.  Camel still disruptive.  Built six nest boxes for poultry.

Sandstone.  Finally cleared the path to the well.  Skeleton starting
to kill dogs, so I will lead a citizen’s-militia squad to kill it.


Diary of Ïngiz Diamondfolded, first-migrant planter, The Folded Banner.

253 Sandstone.  Knighthold the Velvet Slaughter, an undead two-hump
camel skeleton, or the ensuing panic, killed Rakust, Eshtân, Zasit,
Deler, Ilral, and Shorast, as well as a water buffalo calf, turkey gobbler,
three stray dogs, and the dog Åmdoren.  Erush, Tun, and Ïteb are missing,
presumed dead.  Our new expedition leader, Ber Paintsqueezed,
is unconscious but unharmed, and Mebzuth is pale and damaged.
No medical talent or hospital burrow, so Mebzuth may not survive.
15 drink of 334 total food, for 6 dwarves and 22 animals.
Need to assess remaining talent and reassign work.
	Stonedwarf Edëm can mine and craft rock pots and mugs, and
will have to be our mason (we need coffins), mechanic, and jeweler.
Èrith can cut wood and do carpentry, burn wood and smelt ore.
If Ber wakes, will have to do something more useful than tan or weave:
probably broker, and help out Edëm with mechanisms and cutting gems.
If Mebzuth recovers, she can broker, and maybe light work at the fishery.
Vabôk can farm, fish, butcher, and tan.  I can farm, cook, and dye.


Diary of Ber Paintsqueezed, first-migrant expedition leader,
The Folded Banner.

253 Sandstone.  The fighting isn’t over, and the poultry are taking
the brunt of it.  Disgusting purple clouds of rot—let our refuse clutter
the green grass!  Found Mebzuth dead, no ghosts yet.  11 drink of
307 food, for 5 dwarves and 22 animals.  Rebuilding trade depot,
still, and farmer’s workshop.

Timber.  Èrith is melancholy.  Ïngiz is berserk.  Migrants: two soldiers
(which we dearly need), woodcrafter, and animal trainer.  Kulet will
command militia and squad of other military migrants, now only Sarvesh.
Need to establish barracks, probably at end of copper vein.
Kulet couldn’t handle the hostility around here.  No trade caravan.
Vabôk will also gather plants and brew: we have 8 drink of 226 food
for 7 dwarves and 23 animals.


Diary of Vabôk Flukecobalt, first-migrant expedition leader,
The Folded Banner.

253 Timber.  Rakust was the first to die, my spouse rotting in front of me;
since then I revel in this chaos and disorder.  Edëm went berserk and
killed Ber with his pick.  The Mountainhome diplomat left unhappy,
no trade.  Edëm killed Ïngiz, so that’s sorted.  Ber killed Kulet, and
Edëm killed Sarvesh, so no need for barracks.  7 drink of 225 food for
4 dwarves and 23 animals.  More miasma.  The merchants’ hammerdwarf
and the marksdwarf Ùshrir ftook down vomiting and retching Edëm with
gut shots.  Got a still working, to drink as we die and rot.

Moonstone.  30–40–48 drink of 323–333–328 food, for 4 dwarves and
23 animals.  The merchants have been watching us fall apart, and are
leaving soon, as we’ve been unable to set up and staff a trade depot.
Partly my fault I guess, I just found the plans.  General orders to
gather plants, farm, brew, and cook, to keep us alive a while.
Ùshrir wil keep books and broker.  Èrith slipped away.

Opal.  55 seeds, 177 drink, and 473 food, for 3 dwarves and 23 animals.
The ghost appeared of the embark recruit Deler.  We should build a
tradecraft burrow and floodable approach, since shelter is too cluttered.
But for now we just grow food and drink and hold on until more come.
Mebzuth has also risen to haunt us.  All orders for farmer’s workshop.
69 seeds, 234 drink, and 542 food, for 3 dwarves and 23 animals, which
includes 74 hen eggs from the nest boxes.  Start preparing easy and
fine meals.

Obsidian.  83–109 seeds and 279–370 drink of 599–724 food,  for 3
dwarves and 23 animals.  No meat, 26 fish, 25 plant, 194 other.
1 craftsdwarf, 1 fishery worker, 1 farmer.  Meeting area, with people
and animals gathered around, makes it difficult to rebuild nearby
buildings.

254 Granite.  121–128 seeds and 409–433 drink of 765–792 food for
3 dwarves.  47 chicks and ducklings hatched, now 70 animals total.
The small dining room, covered in chicks, no longer a meeting area
Plan to wall in the pastures and remove upward slopes.
	28 migrants, including my daughter Iden Drinkboat!  Third wave:
miner, wood cutter (to be carpenter/wood burner), stoneworker
(also miner), blacksmith etc., jeweler, gem cutter (also miner/
furnace operator), 2 bone carver, clothier, 2 leather workers
(1 mechanic/miner), cook, 2 fishery workers, fish dissector,
fisherdwarf, grower, 3 farmers, 2 brewers, lye maker, spinner, tanner,
engineer, and two children.

Slate.  Minkot Galleydoors replaces Ùshrir Plankenjoy as record keeper.
Plenty of bone around; create butcher’s workshop; reuse craftsdwarf’s
workshop; plan trade burrow.  Build press and quern for miller, leatherworks
and tanner’s workshop for leatherworker, all in top level of shelter.
128–110 seeds and 431–445 drink of 785–806 food for 28–31 dwarves
and 80–84 animals.  All orders for butcher’s workshop.
	Should create a walled meeting hall/dining area exposed to outside.
Should create a bedroom burrow (levels of a 3x3 array of 3x3 bedrooms)
for those dwarves without workplace bedrooms.
	Dug out the depot level of the tradecraft burrow.  Planned wall
and drawbridge to isolate deramped pastures.  All dwarves busy.
Replaced the trade depot.

Felsite.  140 seeds, 484 drink, and 25 meat of 977 food, for 31 dwarves
and 84 animals.  Convicted Ïgniz of the murder of Tun, Ïteb, and Mebzuth.
Convicted Ber of the murder of Kulet.  Should farm within walls above
ground, for variety, and because there are many seeds to be had here.
Tell the kitchen not to cook away the drinks distilled from aboveground
plants.

Hematite.  Elves from Aquaneinefa, "The Dabbling Fell", whined that
Ùshrir accidentally offered them the bin the gems were in, and refused
a profit of 300 on trade of 1510 of our gems.  More gems for the
humans and dwarves, then.  All they had that we actually needed were
bags, to hold seeds.  Broker got back to work.
	169 seeds and 519 drink of around 1100 food, for 31 dwarves
and 84 animals.  Set up a yearlong training schedule for 2 of the 3
soldiers of the Walled System, dug a barracks, and told them to train
there.  The blacksmith will burn wood.
	Digging a deep shaft, down fifty layers, broke into a cavern while
enlarging a marble take.  Plan a drawbridge and controlling lever to
isolate it; upper drawbridges ready as backup.
	Fourth wave of migrants!  The ranger, jack-of-all-trades, and
bone doctor will join the earlier-migrant wood cutter, blacksmiths,
and hunter in an inactive marksdwarf squad, the Diamond Vises.
Metalsmith, gem setter, fish cleaner, farmer, beekeeper, mechanic.
166 seeds and 487 drinks in about 1120 food, for 40 dwarves and
88 animals.

Malachite.  Constructing a wall around an outside farm, with an inside
connection to the rest of the fort.  Bone carvers can also burn wood.
Smith leather and copper helms and armor.  Make pig iron bars for
steel, since we found some flux.  Militia is sparring in barracks
slightly smaller than the chamber, to allow storage along the walls.
Dug a little tunnel under the river, to get to the other side.
Craft rock mugs for trade.  Unforbid various items, including seeds
for more planting, leathers so Stukos’ strange mood does not end
poorly, and corpses for bone crafts.  Still need bags to e.g. mill plants.
198 seeds and 491 drinks in about 1190 food, for 40 dwarves and
88 animals.
	Stukos created an artifact giant-bat leather cloak, so we need
some isolated storage for artifacts, and other treasure, eventually
behind a forbidden artifact door.  For now, turn the center of the
mines into a room.

Galena.  Finished drawbridge by cavern, connected lever: we are now
isolated from the cavern.
	The ghost of Ïgniz battered unconscious a six-year-old child
(daughter of Cog and Minkot), and removed her upper left leg,
so it’s time to put him to rest.  Placed many coffins along the red walk,
and ordered slabs.  Dispersed Mebzuth, and Deler just after he rose.
She recuperates in the barracks, watching sparring practice.
	40 dwarves, by the standard accountings: 88 other animals,
13 farmers, 7 fishery workers, 5 craftsdwarves, 3 miners, 2 children,
2 jewelers, 2 metalsmiths, 1 macedwarf, 1 swordsdwarf, 1 engineer,
1 administrator, 1 ranger, 1 woodworker, no trained animals,
no peasants, and no stoneworkers.  No adult dogs to train as war dogs.
	Planned a store for artifact furniture, (siege) ammo, finished goods,
weapons, trap components, and armor, with a lever in the barracks.
	Set out both the melee and the marksdwarf squad to scare off a
kobold thief.  Bolts, spear, mace, and wrestling mutilated the enemy,
and got back to work and military training.
	We have enough ore, and few enough trees, that it makes sense
to delve for magma, to power forges and smelters.  Set up a drawbridge
before we delve deeper than the cavern we found.
	Appointed Vucar the chief medical dwarf.  Other than a few
hungry dwarves, the only medical case is that of Ilral Channelstandards,
who lost the ability to stand, and requires a crutch.  Ilral was brought
to rest in the barracks bed by the cook Îton.

Limestone.  Smoothing a hospital burrow, digging a new small cistern.
Make more bolts for hunters, to supplement our meager supply
of meat, and so the marksdwarves have something to shoot with.
But out of copper bars.  Found honeybee colony, ordered beehive
for mead.  19 fish, 137 seeds, and 517 drink in about 1240 food.
Trim bar production to (pig) iron/steel for armor and edged weapons,
silver for war hammer and mace, and copper for bolts.
