Diary of Shorast Coloredmined, embark expedition leader, The Folded Banner.

253 Granite.  The Folded Banner stopped aside two other wagons. 
Whatever happened to both of them left their animals as skeletons,
and scattered a few of their belongings.  No sign of their bodies,
either dead for burial, or live to take back in chains for deriliction
of duty.
	They barely started to dig out an all-pile below an embark shelter,
and stairs down a water tunnel and cistern.  The simple plans seem sound,
from what we can tell, and there are no unusual fissures or echoes
from the stone, so we’ll continue to set up the embark shelter.
	I’ll start the books now, to know what we can trade before winter.
Probably mechanisms, to control the many drawbridges that isolate cells.
The first layer of the embark shelter will be trade, food, and capentry.
The second will be a general stockpile, to unload the wagon(s), and
the third will be for the stonedwarves.
	Laid out a general store for shelter: seven lines of food and sundries,
two for a hospital, four for defense.  Let the other wagons be collected,
as the miners dig out the water tunnel, small cistern, stonedwarves cell,
and farm cell, all stacked in our embark shelter.

Slate.  Hollowed three levels of shelter burrow.  Started building
workshops and producing items.  4 plots and kitchen, still, farmer’s;
carpenter’s; trade depot; jeweler’s, mason’s, mechanic’s; crafter’s;
wood furnace, smelter, and forge.  Rock mugs for trade.  A small
meeting hall and dining room by the outsiders, and a small dormitory
by the stonedwarves.  Top priority is cistern and well before winter.

Felsite.  Finished meeting hall and dining room.  Ran out of ordinary
rock, so mined a frame, found rough red zircon.  Told miner/mason
Eshtân Auraquakes to cut gems, and woodworker/carpenter Èrith
Shieldbelts to make charcoal and smelt ore.

Hematite summer.  Migrants to relieve Eshtân as mason and jeweler,
and Zasit as fisherdwarf and fish cleaner.  Overall, a stoneworker,
a gem cutter, two farmers, a fishery worker, a tanner, a wood crafter,
and a glazer.  Set up a fishery by the river.  108 food.

Malachite.  Mining galena hematite¸ and native copper.  71 drink of
164 total food, for 15 dwarves and 19 animals.  Exported 0 of 9,486
created wealth.

Galena.  Responded to report of a kobold thief from Strugufusrulgin.
Rakust Pulleydriven is a competent swordsdwarf, so became military
commander and leader of the Walled Systems, and chased off the
unwelcome intruder.  Also encountered an animated remnant of the first
two embarks, a two-humped camel skeleton, which interrupted work,
and killed Rakust sent to dispatch it.  Returned Eshtân to masonry and
stone detailing, to make a coffin for Rakust.  The hallowed hematite
vein will be our red ghost-disperse, Angngotololum.

Limestone.  Camel still disruptive.  Built six nest boxes for poultry.

Sandstone.  Finally cleared the path to the well.  Skeleton starting
to kill dogs, so I will lead a citizen’s-militia squad to kill it.


Diary of Ïngiz Diamondfolded, first migrant planter, The Folded Banner.

253 Sandstone.  Knighthold the Velvet Slaughter, an undead two-hump
camel skeleton, or the ensuing panic, killed Rakust, Eshtân, Zasit,
Deler, Ilral, and Shorast, as well as a water buffalo calf, turkey gobbler,
three stray dogs, and the dog Åmdoren.  Erush, Tun, and Ïteb are missing,
presumed dead.  Our new expedition leader, Ber Paintsqueezed,
is unconscious, and Mebzuth is pale.  No medical talent or hospital cell,
so Mebzuth may not survive.  15 drink of 334 total food, for 6 dwarves
and 22 animals.  Need to assess remaining talent and reassign work.
