Hide Items or Buildings

They may throw tantrums or go completely berserk, killing and
destroying things.  This is why you want them to be happy.

Generally speaking, any type of thing you can gather on the surface
you can gather from a cavern, but each ecosystem has its own types of
flora (eg trees) and fauna (eg fish).

Hunting is also a good way to have a dwarf train the Marksdwarf skill.
[Gather hunters/marksdwarves in a 2-active archer squad, with a
crossbow, quiver, and bolts each, wearing leather armor.  Provide
archery practice for the squad to practice inside, during siege or
when no animals available to hunt.]

Some people brew all plants and have dwarves only eat meat.
Dwarves are perfectly happy with this arrangement.

Use the trade depot as a garbage dump.

You can Hide Items or Buildings so that they don't appear
on the map.  You can later unhide them.
