Outpost Channeldells, Slate 252, Zulban Hatchedfolded

Now that the barracks are set, we can start training.  We have
Sibrek and Atír Islandpulley hand-to-hand sparring right away.

Temporary stone workshops are blocking the way to the trade depot, so
they’ll be first to move to their area.  After that probably the keep,
to provide a place to sleep, store food and drink and weapons, and eat
and drink and gather and get water safely.

Once we get another entrance, through the farm area, we can build and
test the drawbridge over the channel.  Once that's in order, finish
walling off the farm.

Drawing up plans to remove ramps and wall off the pond on level 142,
and the alcove southwest of the pool bottom on 141, for more farms
and pastures.  Should probably wait until we have more dwarfpower.

Pile magma-safe stone in the middle of the stone work area.
Build mason¹ (I stop mining), jeweler, mechanic,² and crafter.³
 ¹ Order quern for farm; 2 floodgates and a wall grate for keep’s
water supply; tables and doors for keep and barracks; and blocks for
drawbridges: 3x3 by outside, 4 1x4 around barracks, and 1x2 for keep.
 ² Order and store many mechanisms for levers and connections for
floodgates and drawbridges.
 ³ Hive, nest box, pots, jugs.

Give orders to kitchen, still, and farmer’s workshop.  Prevent cacao
pods from being used up in cooking and brewing.

Digging out water supply to keep, before keep, to give time to get
mechanisms ready while keep is dug out.  Toward that end, stop masonry
for a while.  You would think I would know better than to seal myself
in with a floodgate just before my draft.  Now they’re both down
there, and we probably won’t make any more progress until we have
levers and mechanisms to hook them up.  Which means we have to dig out
the keep first.

In the cellar store prepared food, drink, and useable metal weapons
and armor.  Set up four beds in the hospital to sleep semi-properly.

Three migrants.  Litast Anguishedcave can operate our smelter if we
find any metal, and can shear our woolly animals.  Most importantly
he's good at figuring out what’s wrong with a dwarf, so he gets to be
chief medical dwarf, have his very own little hospital, and head the
hospital squad.  Bomrek Ironspotted makes clothes, processes plants,
cooks, crafts wood, and gets those little threads out of raw adamantine,
so she’ll be on the farms until we praise the miners.  Stodir Roundedknife
is another mechanic, so I can get back to masonry and smoothing and
engraving.
