nb stair corridor connect area trade depot
Minor stairwells (1x1) and corridors (1-wide) interconnect a pod.
Major stairwells (2x2) and corridors (2-wide) connect pods to other
pods or special-purpose areas.¹ Each barracks gathers the endpoints of
four major stairwells, and contains a lever by each stairs to block
its corridor with a 1-wide drawbridge.  A single 3-wide corridor
connects trading area to outside.
 ¹ For example, outside, mines, magma furnaces, caverns.

For example, the barracks nearest outside would have 2x2 stair to the
trading depot, and a lever by the stair to close a 1-wide draw bridge
between the trading depot and the stair.  Similarly, it would have 2x2
stairs to underground farms in the soil, and a walled pen outside; a
nearby stone-collection 11x11, radiating mine shafts;¹ or directly to
the barracks of another pod.
 ¹ Which may wander past the caverns to another stone-collection area,
connected 2x2 to the barracks of another pod.


nb building destroyer wall bridge hatch cover grate
Building destroyers will not destroy constructed walls and bridges, or
forbidden hatches and grates from below, and cannot get to things
blocked by channels, so use these in key defenses.

nb zolakònul blizzardmirrored
Keep an eye on the gorillas.  Respond to the environment with my
capabilities.  Exploit nature: mine magnetite and limestone, and cut
down trees, to start metal industry.  Wall off those areas as fortress
rooms.  There are a few gems, so set up a jeweler.  Build fishery and
carpenter outside.  That should busy the first 7.

My plans actually have a point.  Execute them in the order they’re
needed, but it serves needs like water, a dining room, etc., and gets
practice digging before moving on to mining material I want left
behind.

Outpost Channeldells, Granite 252, Zulban Hatchedfolded

Stopped the wagon on a steep wooded face of sand and siltstone,
sprinkled with aventurine and a few sard.  Plan rooms of sand to farm
our crops, and stone for the quern and smelter.  Once we dig out the
barracks I'll start chiselling stone.  Workshop order: fishery
(outside), carpenter (outside), entry (trade depot, craft area),
barracks, farm, stone industry (mason, mechanic, crafter, and
jeweler), wood industry (carpenter, wood furnace), keep (water, store
food and drink, hospital using dorm beds, locked refuse, dining room),
bedrooms.

In addition to the new barracks chokepoints, we also carry new plans
for a trade pile and production area.  We'll have levers in the
barracks for both the 3x3 outside drawbridge, and the 1x2 trade
drawbridge.
