nb minimum military gear equipment
General minimum for gear is a helm for the head (I often add a metal
cap as well); chain shirt (breastplate is good too, but doesn't cover
some areas that the chain shirt does—I use both); gauntlets for the
hands and lower arms; greaves for the legs (or chain leggings, but
greaves cover more); and low or high boots in metal.  I also tend to
add a cloak, hood, and mittens for at least minimal coverage of other
areas.  One handed weapon and a shield.

Armor: helm, metal cap; chain shirt, breastplate; gauntlet; greaves,
chain leggings; low/high boots.  Clothier: cloak, hood, mittens
