[Wirth] used the compiler’s self-compilation speed as a measure of the
compiler’s quality.  Considering that Wirth’s compilers were written
in the languages they compiled, and that compilers are substantial and
non-trivial pieces of software in their own right, this introduced a
highly practical benchmark that directly contested a compiler’s
complexity against its performance.  Under the self-compilation speed
benchmark, only those optimizations were allowed to be incorporated
into a compiler that accelerated it by so much that the intrinsic cost
of the new code addition was fully compensated.
