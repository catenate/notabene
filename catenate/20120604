And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

nb introduce text editor sam paper rpike
Pike, R. 198711.  The text editor sam.  Software—Practice and
Experience 17:11:813–845.
http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/sam/

Sam is an interactive multi-file text editor intended for bitmap displays.
A textual command language supplements the mouse-driven, cut-and-paste
interface to make complex or repetitive editing tasks easy to specify.
The language is characterized by the composition of regular expressions
to describe the structure of the text being modified.  The treatment
of files as a database, with changes logged as atomic transactions,
guides the implementation and makes a general ‘undo’ mechanism
straightforward.

Sam is implemented as two processes connected by a low-bandwidth
stream, one process handling the display and the other the editing
algorithms.  Therefore it can run with the display process in a bitmap
terminal and the editor on a local host, with both processes on a
bitmap-equipped host, or with the display process in the terminal and
the editor in a remote host.  By suppressing the display process,
it can even run without a bitmap terminal.

This paper is reprinted from Software—Practice and Experience, Vol 17,
number 11, pp.  813-845, November 1987.  The paper has not been
updated for the Plan 9 manuals.  Although Sam has not changed much
since the paper was written, the system around it certainly has.
Nonetheless, the description here still stands as the best introduction
to the editor.

I just had to write up some notes on this kind of issue myself.  After  
a bit of time combing through various other lists and links on getting  
Inferno to talk to sources (or any 9fs mount), I jotted down the  
following tools and notes for using Inferno more successfully.
	Factotum needs to be able to get back and authenticate when
connecting to sources.  Add the following to /lib/ndb/local .¹
Before attempting to connect to network services, make sure the
following programs are running [ps].²  If /n/sources doesn't exist,
or you need to create it on demand or per user, ³.  Now you're ready
to connect to sources.⁴  Feedkey will prompt you as required for
authentication if required.  If all works, sources will be mounted.
 ¹ auth=sources.cs.bell-labs.com
authdom=outside.plan9.bell-labs.com
 ² ndb/cs
auth/factotum
auth/feedkey
 ³ mount -ac {mntgen} /n
 ⁴ mount -9 tcp!sources.cs.bell-labs.com!9fs /n/sources
	Now hopefully Google will index this listserv and more so I
can find these notes again.
