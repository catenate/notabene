Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect—
this is the “strong opinion” part.  Then—and this is the “weakly held” part—
prove yourself wrong.  Engage in creative doubt.  Look for information
that doesn’t fit, or indicators that point in an entirely different direction.
