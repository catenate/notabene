(Temporarily) combining two directories in Linux

Summary

The bash script bcu uses sudo to make the files and directories in one
Linux directory temporarily appear within another’s (if they don’t
already exist) while running a command (shell), and keep their changes
after unmount.

Why?

Sometimes I want two directories to (temporarily) become one, so I can
treat all their contents as appearing in the same place.

For examples, I would not have to add yet another directory to a path,
account in a program for files living in more than one place, remember
which directory I used to store files, or re-add my own new (build)
files to a third-party source tree each time I update it to a new version.

At the same time, directory hierarchies are useful to keep things
separate, so I can work with one aspect of a filesystem without
changing others, as in the last example.

Wherefore?

The operating systems that Bell Labs developed after Unix (Plan 9
and Inferno) have a command called bind¹ that accomplishes this,
but bind in Linux is a bash builtin that maps keyboard keys to shell
commands.² One of the really neat features of the later-OS bind
commands is that it mixes the two directories together, so several
other directories can be bound in one place.  In Inferno, this is used
to construct one single directory with all the programs in the system,
so there is no $PATH.

Not in Linux?

I didn’t think I could do this in Linux, since I thought Linux mount
only works to bind a device to a mount point.  I just learned that
Linux since 2.4 can `mount --bind`³ directories over other directories,
or files over other files, within one filesystem.  Unlike the later OSes,
this does not combine the directories: instead it simply lays one
(source) over another (destination), so you don’t see the contents of
the destination.⁴

Bind, command, unmount

So I wote a quick script (took longer to write this post and explain it)
to actually combine two directories into one, execute a command,
and then un-combine them.  The command can be a shell, to noodle
around in the combined filesystem before the script unmounts it.

usage: bcu $src $dst $cmd
        mount files from $src in $dst while running $cmd

Notes

The script uses sudo, since Linux requires root access to mount.
It only uses sudo to mount and unmount, not for the user command.

The script is safe: if any file in the source directory already exists
in the destination directory, the script will abort instead of mounting.

The script cleans up after itself, removing all the mount points it
created to bind files or subdirectories into the destination directory.

Any changes you make to the files, or files you add to the bound
subdirectories, are stored in the source file tree, and so accessible
through the source file tree as you make changes in the destination
file tree.

Bcu stands for either mount --Bind, Command, and Unmount; or Blessed|
Cursed|Uncursed, depending on how much a Nethack fan you are.
