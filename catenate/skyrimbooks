Fallen First-Era Mer and Modern Study of Their Interests:
A Library in the Reading Room of Vlindrel Hall of Nchuand-Zel, Markarth Side.
Curated by Argis of the Bookshelf, Dragonborn Companion.

Atop many stairs in the northeast quarter of a worn, carved city;
behind an ancient, gleaming door of unstained, irreproducible metal;
in an unornamented squared room of stone; sit three bookshelves,
surrounded by an array of hide-bound chairs and pelted benches.

This is the reading room of the library of the fallen first-era elves,
and the best modern treatises along the lines of of their interests,
at Vlindrel hall, on the Markarth side of Nchuand-Zel.

The library proudly presents (translations of) original works by the
Dwemer, or “deep” elves, of northern Tamriel; Falmer, or “snow” elves,
of Skyrim and Solstheim, and Ayleid, or “wild” elves, of Cyrodiil and
Valenwood.  The library also collects journals of travel to their sites,
and interactions recorded in contemporary sources by other cultures.

In joint effort with Calcelmo of Markarth and the College of Winterhold,
the library preserves copies of treatises and journals of scholarship
and research.  The library also keeps on hand popular books of more
inconsistent truth, and the most interesting passing mentions of
first-era individuals and their culture.

Since the library hopes to bring to mind these cultures’ way of life,
it also contains the best modern works in studies along the lines
pursued originally by the fallen civilizations, to compare with how
much we have accomplished and sustained.  For the Dwemer,
heavy armor, the elder scrolls, and riddles.  For the Falmer,
the worship of Auri-el.  For the Ayleid, stars, magic, and dædra.

The library is joined, in recalling the works of the Dwemer, by the
Museum curated by Calcelmo, which presents artifacts found in the city,
and excavated from the ruins of Nchuand-Zel behind and beneath.
