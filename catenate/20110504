Saxe, J.G.  1872.  The blind men and the elephant: A hindoo fable.
The poems of John Godfrey Saxe.
http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Blindmen_and_the_Elephant

And so these men of Indostan
 Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
 Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
 And all were in the wrong!

So, oft in theologic wars
 The disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance
 Of what each other mean,
And prate about an Elephant
 Not one of them has seen!
