You don’t import projects into Gerrit.  You point it to your git repos
and it operates directly on them.  I'd look at the log file for gerrit
to see if it’s complaining about any paths or anything.  One tip:
for us, ¹ is sourced by ².  In it, we set the umask to “2” so that
files and directories created by gerrit will be group-writable.
This is important if you have different users using gerrit, which is
the whole point.
 ¹ /etc/default/gerritcodereview
 ² test_site/bin/gerrit.sh
