nb ddunning jkruger effect cognitive bias perceive actual skill
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect

The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which unskilled people
make poor decisions and reach erroneous conclusions, but their
incompetence denies them the metacognitive ability to appreciate their
mistakes.  The unskilled therefore suffer from illusory superiority,
rating their ability as above average, much higher than it actually is,
while the highly skilled underrate their own abilities, suffering from
illusory inferiority.  This leads to the situation in which less competent
people rate their own ability higher than more competent people.
It also explains why actual competence may weaken self-confidence.
Competent individuals falsely assume that others have an equivalent
understanding.  As Kruger and Dunning (1999) conclude, "Thus, the
miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self,
whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error
about others" (p.  1127).
	The effect is not specifically limited to the observation that
ignorance of a topic is conducive to overconfident assertions about it,
and Dunning and Kruger cite a study saying that 94% of college
professors rank their work as "above average" (relative to their peers),
to underscore that the highly intelligent and informed are hardly exempt.
Rather, the effect is about paradoxical defects in perception of skill,
in oneself and others, regardless of the particular skill and its
intellectual demands, whether it is chess, playing golf or driving a car.

One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty
are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled
with doubt and indecision.

nb sun light water split mit dnocera solar cell card silicon nickel cobalt hydrogen oxygen gas fuel cell electricity energy
Yale Environment 360.  20110329.  Solar 'artificial leaf' Is unveiled
by researchers.  Reuters.
http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idus81168260920110329?ca=rdt

About the size of a playing card, the solar cell—which uses inexpensive
and widely available materials like silicon—is able to split water
into its two components, hydrogen and oxygen.  Placed in a gallon of
water in bright sunlight, the device could produce enough electricity
to supply a house in a developing country with electricity for a day.
The hydrogen and oxygen gases produced by the artificial leaf could be
stored in a small fuel cell, which would use the gases to generate
electricity.  … Nocera's recent discovery of inexpensive catalysts,
including nickel and cobalt, has made the technology more efficient
and cost-effective.
