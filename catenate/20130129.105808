Impose a specific ordering on the rules to be invoked without
forcing the target to be updated if one of those rules is executed.
Order-only prerequisites can be specified by placing a pipe symbol (|)
in the prerequisites list: any prerequisites to the left of the pipe
symbol are normal; any prerequisites to the right are order-only.
