Pen-on-paper flexible electronics are fabricated using a conductive
silver ink-filled rollerball pen.  This approach provides a low-cost,
portable route for fabricating conductive text, electronic art,
interconnects for light emitting diode (LED) arrays, and three-
dimensional (3D) antennas on paper.

Paper was used in the study because it is considered to be the most
suitable non-standard material for printing circuits due to its wide
availability, low cost, ability to be bent and shaped, and the fact
that it is biodegradable.  Lewis noted that the paper used in study
was folded after testing to see how the circuit would hold up, and
discovered it took folding several thousand times before the ink
pathways were broken.  She also noted that other materials besides
paper could be used, such as wood or ceramics.
