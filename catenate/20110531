nb release software mistake autotools make distcheck build system scons waf cmake gradle maven gant sbt leiningen
laurencetratt: No matter how often I do it, releasing software doesn't
get any easier.  It's always a nerve-wracking experience!

russel_winder: @laurencetratt Possibly means you're not releasing often
enough and/or you haven't got enough automation to the release process?

laurencetratt: @russel_winder I remember a Linux kernel release ~'98
that sometimes didn't compile.  Mistakes can happen easily, no matter
the automation!

rossburton: @laurencetratt and that is why god invented autotools and
make distcheck

laurencetratt: @rossburton I had never previously thought of autotools as
being designed in heaven.  I am choosing my words very carefully here.

rossburton: @laurencetratt sure it's a bit weird but it works.
Bit like the duck billed platypus really.

russel_winder: @rossburton But sticking with Autotools when you have SCons,
Waf, CMake, Gradle, Maven, Gant, SBT, Leiningen, Ant to choose from?

rossburton: @russel_winder they suck more for what I want a build
system to do.

Rúnar.  20110530.  Imperative vs functional programming.
Apocalisp: The end of programming as you know it.
http://apocalisp.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/imperative-vs-functional-programming/

On the validity of the FP approach.  On the utility of the FP
approach.  On the way programmers think.  A word on OO and
the arbitrary.  On “types of languages”.

Functional programming is a restriction that the programmer puts on
his programs.


nb startup relationship ask help
Freedman, J.  20110531.  You don't get shit you don't ask for.
humbledMBA: Jason Freedman's lessons learned… and relearned.
http://www.humbledmba.com/you-dont-get-shit-you-dont-ask-for

"If there's ever anything I can ever do to help, please let me know."

Ask for what you want.  This is a common Paul Graham statement to YC
companies.  Figure out exactly what you need and just ask for it.
Don't play games, don't posture, don't hint.  Just ask for what you want.

Make your request very concrete.  We didn't ask for general advice.
We did our homework and made very specific requests.  It's much easier
for people to respond to concrete requests.  Even if they can't
provide for that direct request, the specificity of the request helps
them find an alternative way to help.
 
Don't use and abuse.  I only wanted to ask these incredibly busy
investors for help once or maybe twice.  Obtaining industry
introductions was one of the most important necessities of
our startup.  I made sure to ask for something that they could provide
with minimal effort and risk.
 
Pay it forward.  We're all part of the same innovation community.
This whole entrepreneurship thing is hard for everyone,
but fortunately, everyone has something to offer.  Don't procrastinate
on giving back.
 
Say thank you.  Investors love knowing the outcome.  For both personal
and professional reasons, they're interested in long term relationships.
Do your part by keeping them up to date with your successes.
I like to email everyone that helped me immediately prior to something
showing up on Techcrunch.  It helps me communicate to them that I
appreciate everything they did to be a part of our success.


nb credo dodep library vary system compile command
Since the system's do-library is separate from files delivered in a
source-code package, source code doesn't have to deliver an entire
build system.  source code can say in its guide file or configure-like
script that it wants the system-standard way to compile files of the
program’s languages.  The system’s do library will also identify itself,
for conditional compilation or to choose which system-specific source
files build.
