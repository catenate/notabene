test: order beagle bone black (bbb)
next: sshfs to mount nano fs on main Ubuntu/Linux box, and vice-versa
next: install inferno on bbb
next: each (cluster cc i o) do script runs its  .i→.o transform on the least-loaded cluster machine
next: a script returns the least-loaded cluster machine, as rated by uptime’s load average
backlog: use sshfs to work with credo agents, to minimize agent requirements
backlog: use ccache on server, if cache misses send job to agents
backlog: use but don’t distribute ccache, to keep agents anonymous, little-vested, and lightweight
backlog: research kvm switch with hdmi to switch mouse/keyboard between computers
backlog: order raspberry pi (rpi)
backlog: install plan 9 on rpi: web http://trogrd.tumblr.com/post/38874675677/plan-9-on-rasberry-pi
backlog: install latest angstrom linux: web http://downloads.angstrom-distribution.org/demo/beaglebone/
backlog: http://beagleboard.org/Getting%20Started
backlog: google 4-port kvm switch usb hdmi vga
backlog: get cable from bbb microhdmi to extra monitor hdmi
backlog: get 5VDC power supply from e.g. adafruit
backlog: don’t use ccache on agents, to keep them anonymous, little-vested, and lightweight
backlog: distribute ccache across cluster via sshfs, or properly shared filesystem, to share prebuilt .i→.o objects
