nb rush freewill song music lyrics mythos

There are those who think that life is nothing left to chance, 
A host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance. 

A planet of playthings, 
We dance on the strings 
Of powers we cannot perceive. 
"The stars aren't aligned 
Or the gods are malign"- 
Blame is better to give than receive. 

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice. 
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice. 
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill; 
I will choose a path that's clear- 
I will choose Free Will. 

There are those who think that they were dealt a losing hand, 
The cards were stacked against them- they weren't born in lotus-land. 

All preordained- 
A prisoner in chains- 
A victim of venomous fate. 
Kicked in the face, 
You can't pray for a place 
In heaven's unearthly estate. 

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice. 
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice. 
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill; 
I will choose a path that's clear- 
I will choose Free Will. 

Each of us- 
A cell of awareness- 
Imperfect and incomplete. 
Genetic blends 
With uncertain ends 
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet.
