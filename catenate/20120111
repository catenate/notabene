Communication and coordination overhead rises dramatically with team
size.  In the worst possible case where everyone on the project needs
to communicate and coordinate with everyone else, the cost of this
effort rises as the square of the number of people in the team.
That’s such a powerful effect, in fact, that a large team couldn’t
possibly hope to achieve the goal of everyone coordinating their
effort.  But a small team could.

QSM found another explanation for the huge cost differential between
small and large teams.  The defect rate for the large teams was five
times greater than for the small teams.  Defects consume time in
discovery, documentation, and repair.  That effort is obviously
necessary, but doesn’t contribute directly to creating the desired
software, and therefore inflates cost without any benefit to the
schedule.
