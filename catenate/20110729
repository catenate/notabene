	      Select  only  those  lines  containing  matches that form whole
	      words.  The test is that the matching substring must either  be
	      at  the  beginning  of the line, or preceded by a non-word con-
	      stituent character.  Similarly, it must be either at the end of
	      the  line	 or  followed  by  a  non-word constituent character.
	      Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the under-
	      score.


nb online partial evaluate function program language
Cook W.R.  and LÃ¤mmel, R.  2011 Tutorial on online partial evaluation.
To appear in proceedings of DSL 2011.

This paper is a short tutorial introduction to online partial evaluation.
We show how to write a simple online partial evaluator for a simple,
pure, first-order, functional programming language.  In particular,
we show that the partial evaluator can be derived as a variation on a
compositionally defined interpreter.  We demonstrate the use of the
resulting partial evaluator for program optimization in the context of
model-driven development.
