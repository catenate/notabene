This talk introduces the Git Version Control System by looking at what
Git is doing when you run the commands you need to do basic version
control with it.  We'll look at how to use Git to do the basics,
while seeing how it differs from Subversion, what staging and
committing actually looks like, how it stores its data, how it
branches and merges so nicely and how it talks to a server when
pushing and fetching.  Then we'll look at how to look at your history
with log in interesting ways.  This should help Git newbies get
acquainted with the popular VCS and other Git users get a glimpse of
what's happening under the hood.
