A map of London, using only the names of places as cartographic symbols.

For example, a bridge is the name of the bridge across some white
space, since you don't often need to name the river.  On the larger
image, you can see the meandering course of the Thames, and the
undeveloped white space of parks, estates, and cemeteries.  On the
smaller image, you can actually see the names.
