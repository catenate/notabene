It is difficult to build user interfaces that must be distributed over
a set of dynamic and heterogeneous I/O devices.  This difficulty
increases when we want to split, merge, replicate, and relocate the UI
across a set of heterogeneous devices, without the application
intervention.  Furthermore, using generic tools, e.g.  to search for
UI compoments or to save/restore them, is usually not feasible.
We follow a novel approach for building UIs that overcomes these
problems: Using distributed file systems that export widgets to
applications.  In this paper we describe Omero, a UI server built
along this line for the Plan B Operating System.
