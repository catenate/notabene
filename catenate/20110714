nb chkdsk disk memory cache shutdown crash power
catena: Your computer does not actually write files to the hard disk
when it says it does, because if it did then it would go much slower.
The processor is much much faster than the disk.  So part of what a
computer does when you shut down is go through all the little bits of
files that it loaded up into main memory, and write them all out to disk,
so the system is in the state you expect, the next time you turn it on.
If, however, the computer just suddenly stops running, either because
it crashed or you shut off the power, the hard disk will still be in a weird
state, which chkdsk tries to clean up, producing the results you see.
I'm not actually sure it has much to do with the fragmentation of
files across your hard disk, because an orphan file isn't an orphan
because it's split up into pieces, it's an orphan because the
directory no-longer refers to it (for example, the file was deleted
from the directory, and the directory update made it out to disk,
but the file wasn't marked as deleted).  Overall, I wouldn't worry if
you don't get stuff like this often, just try to be gentle when you
bring down your computer.
