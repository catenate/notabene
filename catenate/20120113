nb _buy credo checksum reuse sum file derived object
For each run, store list of checksums of .sum files after dependencies
updated, along with path to file generated for .sum file.  If the
checksum for an updated .sum file matches an already-stored checksum,
copy the derived-object file associated with the already-stored
checksum to the file associated with the updated .sum file.

Also consider the .do file.
