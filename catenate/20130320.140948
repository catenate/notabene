Open letter to Teen-ager

Always we hear the plaintive cry of the teen-ager.  What can we do?…
Were can we go?

The answer is GO HOME!

Hang the storm windows, paint the woodwork.  Rake the leaves,
mow the lawn, shovel the walk.  Wash the car, learn to cook,
scrub some floors.  Repair the sink, build a boat, get a job.

Help the minister, priest, or rabbi, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army.
Visit the sick, assist the poor, study your lessons.  And then when
you are through—and not too tired—read a book.

Your parents do not owe you entertainment.  Your city or village does
not owe you recreational facilities.

The world does not owe you a living…  You owe the world something.

You owe it your time and your energy and your talents so that no one
will be at war or in poverty or sick or lonely again.

Grow up; quit being a crybaby.  Get out of your dream world and develop
a backbone, not a wishbone, and start acting like a man or a lady.

You're supposed to be mature enough to accept some of the
responsibility your parents have carried for years.

They have nursed, protected, helped, appealed, begged, excused,
tolerated and denied themselves needed comforts so that you could have
every benefit.  This they have done gladly, for you are their dearest treasure.

But now, you have no right to expect them to bow to every whim and
fancy just because selfish ego instead of common sense dominates your
personality, thinking and request.

In Heaven's name, grow up and go home!

―South Bend Tribune, Sunday, Dec. 6, 1959.
