The following are scans of high quality polaroid photographs of the
screen of the Xerox Star 8010 workstation on its launch in 1981.
Some of these photographs show earlier icon development.
See Norm Cox's even earlier Star icon development pages to look at the
evolution of Star's icons up to this final product.

The Xerox Star 8010 "Dandelion". Digibarn computer museum.
http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/index.html

The Xerox Star 8010 "Dandelion" is one of the most significant introductions
of any computer system.  The DigiBarn museum has a special interest in the
lineage of Xerox workstations but especially the Star—Viewpoint—Globalview
series as these represented the most complete implementation of the
"Desktop Metaphor" of any systems until the advent of mature Desktop
graphical interfaces later on the Mac and PC/Unix/Linux in the 1990s.
These systems were a full 15 years ahead of their time with sophisticated
WYSIWYG document composition, built in Ethernet, email, scanning networked
laser printing, development environments including Smalltalk, and much more.
The Xerox workstations, while a commercial failure, occupy an important
position in the lineage of visual computing systems.  There is a lot packed
into the "D Machines" or "Wildflowers" and a big story behind them, which
will be elaborated on this site in the future.  DigiBarn Museum Curator
Bruce Damer's work on the Elixir Desktop was directly inspired and
derivative of the graphical desktops you see here.
