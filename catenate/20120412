nb chitchens death certain enjoy life enough
The only position that leaves me with no cognitive dissonance
is atheism.  It is not a creed.  Death is certain, replacing both the
siren-song of Paradise and the dread of Hell.  Life on this earth,
with all its mystery and beauty and pain, is then to be lived far more
intensely: we stumble and get up, we are sad, confident, insecure,
feel loneliness and joy and love.  There is nothing more; but I want
nothing more.
