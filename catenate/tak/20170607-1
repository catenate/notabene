8x8 me v me.  Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in
adjacent corners, White starts by playing any piece.  First and second
player strategy: build roads, divide opponent roads, only take when
forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.


Problems with start: white has tempo/start/extra piece, and an easy
win condition that forces black to respond.

Separate who has the easy win condition from who has the start/extra piece.

With the proposed start, black has both the start and and two easy win conditions.

Player with the extra piece is the player who plays first.

Player with the easy win condition is the one with a corner-crawl win
from eir first pieces.

Let's see whether having one of White's two capstones in play at the
beginning of the game, and having White play just like Black, helps
White win (which ey never seems to do).  Here we're trying to balance
the leading move (Black's), against better pieces in play (White's),
and closer positioning (White's).  Also, let's have Black wait to play
a capstone until ey needs one.
