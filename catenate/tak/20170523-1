5x5 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts.
First player strategy: limit first player's options by controlling the board through captures, walls, and the capstone.
Second player strategy: play flat, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.

1.	...	a5
2.	a1	e1
3.	Cc3	e2

White plays eir capstone early to establish control and influence in
the center of the board.

4.	e3	d3
5.	c+3	d4

White wants to firmly shut down this first road attempt.  Black responds
by playing towards both eir own e-file and rank-5 potential roads,
as well as the white rank-3 road.

6.	c3	a3

White expands the rank-3 road, and Black blocks the direct path as
well as building up a potential road along the a file.

7.	b3	a4
8.	a2'	a+3
9.	c-3	c3
10.	2b+3'	e2+
11.	2d+3	c4

White is taking control of a captive, to run a road down rank 3, and
re-establish tak.

12.	3e-3'	c4-
13.	b+3	Cc4

Black is trying to get White to throw the stack with black prisoners,
freeing some of them, or run the stack and get some under his control.
This is more effective with a capstone.  White, of course, would rather
run the stack down the 3rd file to recreate eir road and compound tak
threat.

14.	5c-3:32'	c4-

Black wants to separate the white road, as well as the white capstone
from the black prisoners at b3.

15.	b4'	c-3
16.	b5	3b3+12

By completing the road other than b3, White sets emself up to throw
the stack at d3 to put eir capstone in that position, which pins the
black capstone there.  By running the stack at b3 up the b file, Black
overruns the upper part of the white road on the b file, and sets it up
so the same throw helps Black create a road along ranks 3 and 4.
