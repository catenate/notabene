nb color shade computer ui move choice block win

rabbitboy84: Another option, which is probably less feasible,
but closer to live play, would be to increase transparency between
opponents screens.  By this I mean that you would see the stone
selection and placement or stack pickup and separation instead of just
the finished product.

Abyss: In a blitz game you’re advised to keep your eyes on the board.
And the click back and forward to check doesn’t take too long.
I agree with you in a sense that it would be nice to have some
highlighting of some sort, but my only concern is because stack throws
can be so… “big” that seeing a whole row lit up like a Christmas tree
would be aesthetically displeasing.

catenate: The difference in emphasis on the latest move doesn’t have
to be that pronounced: instead of highlighting “like a Christmas tree”,
some different shading, either lighter or darker, might be enough.
I can see some value in lighting up pieces that are actively preventing wins:
for example, a wall that’s preventing a run, so people learning the
game don’t forget.
