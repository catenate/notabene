8x8 me v me.

1.	2f6	c3	# switch colors for this move only
2.	f3	e3
3.	d3	g3
4.	g4	f4

White focuses on building a road on rank 3 (possibly ranks 3 and 4).
Black focuses on interrupting White's road enough to support a file-f road.

5.	e4	f2
6.	b3	f7	

White could play 6. d4, but since it's two moves to set the road from
e3 to g3 (e4- and g4-), and also two moves to set the road from d4 to
g4 (d4 and f3+), and Black could capture f4 with 2f6-11, a better idea
would be to extend either side of the road towards the edges, and wait
to decide which path is needed.  Since White is not yet sure whether
to use d4–h4 or e3–h3, better to build out the road down the third rank,
and b3 has more influence than a3.

7.	a3	f1
8.	d4	f8
9.	h4'	g-3'

White could have won with 10. f3+", to complete the road a3–h4.
Black can win with 10. f6-", to complete the road f1–f8.

10.	g-4'	2f6-11'

Three perfect steps.

11.	f6	3f4+12'
12.	Sf4	2f-5:11

White was forced to play either a standing stone or a capstone at f4.
A standing stone seems a wiser choice: a capstone lacks mobility at
this stage of the game, since the stacks it could run or throw from
are small.

13.	g4	e6
14.	f4-'	e5-
15.	f4	e2'

White exerts a gentle pressure by filling in empty places of the road,
and repeatedly setting up road-opening threats like 16. f-4'.  Even better,
and more elegant, is that White and Black have been trading off tak threats.

16.	f-4'	Sf4

Black can't place a flat on f4, or throw (3f6-12) to f4 to block, since
White has two ways to cover a flat white stone and complete the road
(3f3+12 and 2e+4).  Black loses plays to cover White's flat stones on
rank 4 (16. … d5- 17. 2e-4' e3+ 18. 3d+4'), since white still has tak,
and the black flats are in white stacks.  So Black's situation demands
either a standing stone or a capstone.  The capstone would allow black
a dominant position, and shut down White's ability to complete this road,
but only a standing stone is necessary to block and prevent white from
easily re-establishing tak.  One perfect step.

17.	3e4+12	d6

Whichever way Black could take e5 or e6, White could retake the stack
from the other, with no further influence from Black.  Likewise with
White taking f6, but White does have an influence advantage to take d5,
and correspondingly Black is at a disadvantage in influence to take d4.
So Black could either play d6 or e7, to build up influence to liberate
the two captives at e6; or e4, to fill out the road from f1 to f8.
Building influence wins, because success creates the ability to finish
the road with something like 2e6-12" (assuming no challenge from white
to force f6 into the fray).  Specifically, d6 seems a better choice since,
while e7 is directly in the way of White's building a d1–e8 road,
d6 encourages White to try to build a road immediately next to Black's,
which makes it easier to break up (both for White and for Black).

18.	e7	e4

E4 is a more important position for Black to establish than f5, since
it's more challenged, and invites White into a losing exchange like
19. e5- e3+ 20. d+4 d-6, where Black takes two white captives,
breaks up the bend in White's road, and sets up a run (5e4+122)
over White's road on file e.

19.	f5	g5
20.	f4+	d7

Here capturing is a good move for White because Black can't yet
capture back, and it moves a white flat into position on h5–a3.
Black builds road alternatives, and threatens a white flat that
supports e6.

21.	c5	d+7
22.	3e+6	e8

Black would like to set emself up to liberate the three prisoners at
the end of a run from f6.  If White runs 5f-6:14, then Black is
already set up.  If 6f-6:114, then adding a flat (ie, b6 or c7) to
take c6 won't help, because White can just retake the stack.
If 5f6+14, to cover two black flats and complete half a road up the
f file, then placing a flat at e8 would allow Black to liberate the
prisoners in the stack, and cover the four white flats on file f with
e+8 and then 4f8-112.  White could also run up rank 6 with 5f+6:14,
but other than Black playing f4+, the road to the edge is unchallenged.

23.	5f-6:14	d5+
24.	e-6	Sd5

In addition to trying to liberate eir prisoners, Black's standing
stone interrupts White's road a3–h5.

25.	7d-6:52	d-5
26.	d5'	f4+
27.	5c6+	Sb7
28.	5c7+	b8
29.	f4	b+8
30.	g4'	2f-5
31.	f-4'	3e5-

Black can't just place a flat at f4 because 32. 3f3+12" covers it and
completes the road.  Now is a good time for White to consider placing
a capstone, to flatten the standing stone holding 3 captives.

32.	Cf4	4e4+
33.	f-4'	2c5-11

Black can't both keep the 3 prisoners at e5, and block White's win.
Black can make it expensive, however, taking more prisoners as White
liberates these.  Black can also create some space for the stack at c8
to run down the c file.

34.	b4'	2c-3

White could complete the road from a3–h4 with 35. f3+12".

35.	a4'	3b3+

Black could have blocked with 5c8-1112, but better for Black to delay
running the stack at c8 until White chooses a direction to run the
stack at e5.  White would like to liberate both stacks of white captives.

36.	e4+	b8
37.	4e-5:112	5c+8:1112
38.	f5'	e4+
39.	d+5'	2e7-11

Winner: White, by Tinuë.

Moral of the story is that it can dramatically shorten the game to
build independently of each other, and not necessarily in your favor.

…
,
so Black would be able to run a road where White has little influence,
but better all around for white to start a cross road, and build up
influence aross the board in both directions.

Sum of squares: 3⁲+1⁲ = 10.
