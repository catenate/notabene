8x8 me v me.

New terminology: a "perfect step" is a play that both prevents a tak
threat from becoming a win, and itself results in tak for the player.
One may measure of the beauty of a game, by how many perfect steps
there are, how many runs of perfect steps, and the length of the
longest run of perfect steps.

1.	2h8	a1	# switch colors for this move only

"You get a stack of two in a corner, I get one in another corner and
first move." Central positioning plus a stack of two might be too much
an advantage.

Black prevented white from running up rank 7, to cover Black's road
with 13. 6c+7:222.

There should be a rule that you cannot repeat a board position,
to prevent the board from being in the same position at the end of
move 14.

	13.	6c7-	d7-
	14.	6c6+	d6+

So Black could not move the standing stone at c6 back to c7 to repeat
the board position.

13.	 6c7-222	c7

To avoid the black standing stone capturing the stack at c7,
White runs out the stack over eir own road on files b and c,
and Black starts rebuilding eir road on rank 7.

One perfect step.

21.	d7	2b+7
22.	d-7	5c6+
23.	c6	6c7-24!

White sets up to take over any stack remaining after Black runs the
stack at c7 up rank 7, so Black instead runs over White's road.
The flat count is now 6-9, reversing White's early lead.  White wants
to stop Black from continuing to eat eir road, and get back eir
5 captives.

24.	Cd4	d7'

White can't simply place a flat in the way, because Black can just
cover it and complete the road on rank 7.

	25.	b7	3c-7'

White has no other pieces within range of the road, so has to play
either a standing stone or a capstone.  Since Black has no capstone
nearby, a standing stone is sufficient to block, and liberate two
captives at c7.

25.	Sb7	3c7+
26.	d4-	5c+5

White goes after the stack of 5 captives, so Black gets them out of
the way, revealing (for a moment) a 4-flat road on file c on White's path.
The flat count is 5-12, which more than makes up for Black's slow start.

27.	4c4+121!	Cb6

White swings the flat count to 7-9, adds a capstone to the standing
stone blocking Black's road on rank 7, and gets White's capstone in
position to liberate the two captives at c8.  By placing the capstone,
Black forks White into accepting either the loss of the standing stone
on Black's road, or the loss of the flat, two black captives, and two
reserves at c6.

28.	2c7-	b6+'
29.	7c6+ 5d-5

White wants to maximize eir run over Black's road, to which Black
responds with a tempting offer to leave it alone.  However, if White
liberates 6 captives at c5, then Black immediately wins.

	30.	6c7-51	3c8-"

30.	7c+7:1132!	c7

So instead White runs up rank 7 to cover Black's road, swinging the
flat count from 5-9 to 8-5, and claiming the road on rank 7 for eir own.
Black's plan is to whittle away at that claim, and re-establish the
road as eirs.

31.	Cc6	8c+5
32.	c6+	3c-7
33.	h7	f7

If Black played to capture pieces at g7 and h7, it wouldn't end up
making much difference, and only add to White's stacks.

	33.	…	h8-
	34.	3g+7	g7
	35.	4h-7

Instead Black leaves some bait to hope to recapture three black captives.

	34.	4f7+	g-8
	35.	f7	4f-8:112'
	36.	…	f+8"

White is rather unlikely to fall for that.

34.	c6	Sf6

Black wants to liberate 3 captives at f7.

35.	3g-7	g7
36.	2c7-11	8d5-
37.	c5+	e8
38.	Sc8	d8
39.	c-8	Sc8
40.	2c6+11	d8-'
41.	2c8-	b7+

Black exposes White's flat at b7 in order to prevent 4b+8:112.

42.	3c+7	2b8-
43.	4d-7	d8'
44.	Sc8	Ca8

A flat would have been enough to block Black's road, but White wants
to either liberate eir captives at b8, or force Black's capstone to abandon
its captives, or even (somehow) set up a road win:

	45.	…	3b7+
	46.	…	b+8
	47.	5b8-1121"

Unlikely that Black will fall for that.

45.	b6	a+8'
46.	c+8	b+8
47.	a6'	h8-

White could complete eir road on ranks 6 and 7 with 3f+7".  So Black
increases the number of black flats to cover, to complete the white road,
from 1 to 2, and keeps eir own road near complete.

48.	7f+7:43'?	Sf7

White wants to move all the black captives at f7 away from Black's
standing stone, if some must lose the protection of the capstone.
This move creates a tak threat, and covers part of Black's road—
easily worked around by Black playing a flat at h8, but at least
that's one more required turn).

49.	h-7	4h7-211

White essentially let black swing the flat count from 10-7 to 10-9,
and build a road along the h file, to have more pieces along g7
and h7.  Running the white capstone up rank 7 might not have been
the best idea, but play will tell.

50.	g-7'	h7
51.	h8'	g8-

51. … h7+ wouldn't have blocked the road, since White could have just
completed it with 52. h7.  Black's move was also better because ey
could liberate 3 captives, and restores eir possession on rank 7
before White ran the capstone up rank 7.

52.	2f+7	Sf7
53.	3g+7	f+7
54.	h-7	3h7-111
55.	2g-7'	3h6+21
56.	g6'	h6
57.	b5'	g8

White threatens, and Black blocks, a road from b1 to g8.

58.	5g+7'	h6+
59.	2f+7'	Sf7

White could have won with 60. 8h-7:62", if Black's standing stone
at f7 hadn't forced White's capstone to flatten it alone.

60.	2d+8'	d8
61.	2d7+'	Sd7
62.	Sa8	h3
63.	a8-	g5
64.	2a7+	h2'
65.	2h-7	h1
66.	Sh6	f7-
67.	a7	f7
68.	2a+8'	a8
69.	4b-8'	3b7-'!

One perfect step.  White could have won with 69. 3a+8", which
revealed a road from a8 to b1.  White left a flat on b8 so Black could
not play 68. … Sb8 to block the return of White's standing stone and
two captives.  Black can't block that return with c-8, because then
white could play a flat at c8 to win.  Black wants to block both
roads, from b1 to either a8 or c8, so moves eir capstone to a place
used by both roads.  Another advantage of this move is a tak threat:
70. … 4b+6:1111 flattens the black standing stone at f6, to complete
the road from h1 to f8.  White wants to shut this down regardless of
how play develops around f6.

70.	3e+8	c+8

Another advantage of move 69 by Black is that the black capstone at c8
is now free to take the stack at d8, to liberate two reserves and get
some mobility.  Black has a road in two moves: 2d+8:11 and 4b+6:1111,
if black for some reason didn't respond.

71.	a5'	4d-8:13
72.	3a8-'	2b8-

White could have won with 3a+7", which revealed the road from b1 to a8.

73.	c5'	2b-8

White could have played 2a+8:11" to win, by completing the road from
b1 to c8.

74.	3a7+'	2b7+

Black could play 74. … 4b6- to more surely block White's roads, but
ey would rather try to liberate the 4 black captives at a8, and run
down file a to cover White's road from b1 to a8.

75.	5a8-'	2b-8
76.	4c-7:31	3b7+
77.	6a+7:15'	4b6-

80.	b4	4a8-13
81.	b5'	3b8-111
82.	a+5'	b6-
83.	c-5	4a6+

White planned to re-establish a tak threat with either c5 or 4b5+22.
Black has in mind eventually getting a capstone to f6, in order to
flatten f8 for the h1 to f8 road.

84.	4b+5:22'	7c-4

White runs out the stack at b5 to avoid its capture by Black, and to
establish a tak threat.

85.	c4'	6d-4
86.	d3	4b+6:1111!

Black finally gets a chance to throw a capstone at the standing stone
along the h1-to-f8 road, but at the cost of laying out three white flats,
which black now has to deal with.

87.	4f-8	2f+6:11

White moves three captives out of Black's immediate grasp, so Black
goes for 5 instead, and the road from h1 to h8.  White can't capture
the stack at h7 emself, because then black would win with a flat at g7.
White should't retreat the stack to h8, because it is tall enough to
run down file h, and White can't move the capstone at g7 into position
to block it.  White ca't move the standing stone at e8 into position
to block the h1-to-h8 road, because then Black wins with a flat at f6.

	88.	4e+8:112	f6"

White might as well move eir capstone at g7 into position to block
Black's winning run down file h, and roll up some flats.

88.	3g7-	2h6+'
89.	5g+6	6h-7'

Black wants to minimize the number of captives White can take,
while still being able to complete a road along file h.

White still can't block g8 by throwing the standing stone at e8,
because that leaves a flat stone at f8 connected to the road.

	90.	4e+8:13	g6"

To block Black, white needs to run eir capstone at h6 down file h,
at least as far as h4.  G4 is the farthest down file g, from g7, that
Black can run the capstone.  Leaving g7 empty would not be a
good idea, because then White could play there a standing stone.

90.	5h6-14	6g7-1113'
91.	6h-4	h6'
92.	4e+8:112!	g7'

Bringing in the standing stone gives White the ability to block two
potential roads.

93.	4h8-112	8b4+
94.	5h5-	h6+
95.	b4	7c4-
96.	c4'	2d-4:11

Black gives White an opportunity to set a tak threat, to more effectively block the next one.

97.	c-4'	8c3-
98.	c3	g+3
99.	c2'	8b+5
100.	b6'	2b7-
101.	c6-'	b3+

Black lost eir focus here, concentrating on trying to make a road and
not doing enough to prevent white from making eirs.  So Black has to
abandon a stack of 8 white captives, which White immediately runs up
rank 3 to create another road.

102.	7b+3:11311	3h7-12'

White can't flatten the white standing stone at h4, as Black threatens
to do to complete a road (with the standing stone at h3, leaving
behind the black flat beneath it), because then Black simply runs the
stack at g4 down file g to complete the road g1–g8.

	103.	g+4	3g4-111"

White can't run the stack at g3 down file g, because that is
irrelevant to Black's win.

	103.	2g3-11	h3+"

Since the road Black completes is from h1 to g8, White can usefully
block the road for one turn, and create space for the white stack at g3
to run up the black road on file g, by covering the bottleneck at g7.

103.	7g4+115	h+7'
104.	6g+7	2g5-11'
105.	2e+3:11	2h-3'
106.	5h-4	g-6'
107.	8h-7:17	h6+'
108.	g+7	g3+
109.	2f+3:11'	2g4-'

One perfect step.  White can't move from f7 (a white capstone atop a
stack of 7 black captives) to g7, to block a run up file g from the
stack at g4, because any black flats left at f7 completes Black's road
from h1 to f8, and if White takes all of them, then all Black needs to
do to win is complete the road with a flat.

	110.	8f+7	f7"

Similarly, if White moves the white flat at h7 to block, Black completes
another potential road.

	110.	2h-7	h7"
	110.	2h7-	g7"

The best White can do is block a place earlier in the road.

110.	h3-	h1+
111.	d3+'	4b+4:22
112.	b4'	3c-4
113.	3b6-12'	3d-4:12
114.	d4'	8b+4:53
115.	b5-'	c-4

If White tries to take the stack at c4, ey immediately loses, since he
earlier analysis for move 110 still applies to White's stacks at f7
and h7, and White has no other pieces within range to challenge the
winning roads.

	116.	c3+	g1"

116.	Sg7	8g3+323

125.	6e-4'	2e-5
126.	8d+4:17	4d5-
127.	8f4-	6d+4:33

The flat count is 19-13, with 4 pieces unplayed by White, and 9 pieces
unplayed by Black.  So Black needs to liberate a stack of black flats
in order to compete on the flat count.

137.	5c-7:41	6e+6:222'!

White's intention was to flatten the standing stone at a5, which would
have drawn the stack at e6 down rank 6, to block.

Winner: Black, by Tinuë.

Final flat count: 14 to 18, with 3 white pieces unplayed, and 5 black
pieces unplayed.
