5x5 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts.
First player strategy: limit first player's options by controlling the board through captures, walls, and the capstone.
Second player strategy: play flat, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.

1.	...	a5
2.	a1	e1
3.	Cc3	e2

White plays eir capstone early to establish control and influence in
the center of the board.

4.	e3	d3
5.	c+3	d4

White wants to firmly shut down this first road attempt.  Black responds
by playing towards both eir own e-file and rank-5 potential roads,
as well as the white rank-3 road.

6.	c3	a3

White expands the rank-3 road, and Black blocks the direct path as
well as building up a potential road along the a file.

7.	b3	a4
8.	a2'	a+3
9.	c-3	c3
10.	2b+3'	e2+
11.	2d+3	Cd3

Since White moved eir capstone away from the captives, Black takes
the opportunity to block the white capstone from getting back to them,
and divides White's road, and starts eir own.  Black also keeps White's
capstone on the edge, where it has less influence.

12.	3c3-	d2
13.	4e3-	d1'
14.	3e-2'	e1+
15.	e3	e1
16.	b2'	d+3
17.	4d+2'	Sd2

Black hems in the white capstone with the black capstone and a wall,
which prevents it from running down the second file with its captives.
If White wants to flatten the wall, it has to give up its captives.
This is a good reason for a capstone to take a flat of the same color
immediately beneath it, a lieutenant, deputy, or assistant.

18.	b4'	b5
19.	c5'	a+4
20.	c4'	d-4

White could also play c3 for tak, but it's better to prevent Black
from setting up a tak (20.  c3' c4') as ey blocks White's tak.

21.	c5-	d-2

White wants to be able to run the stack at c4 for tak.  It occurs to
black that running the stack at c2, up the c file, both shuts down
White's road, and creates one of eir own; or, if White throws the
capstone onto the standing stone at c2, frees Black's reserves.

22.	3c+4:12	4c2+112'!

White opts to run the stack at c4 up the fourth rank, to spare it from
Black's control.  Black runs the stack at c2 as far as possible,
to block White's nearly-diagonal road, set up tak, and get eir
standing stone out of the way.

23.	d3	c2'
24.	b+3'	b3

White could block at b4, c4, c3, or c2.  Eir decision should be
informed by eir ability to play 5e-2 to furnish the final 2 pieces of
a road on the second rank.

25.	2c3-'	b3-

White had a compound tak: 5e-2, or d2, or c3.

26.	a+2	2e3+'
27.	d-4	e-3:12'

Black's plan is to run the capstone back with two captives (3c+4) to
finish the road.

28.	d+4	3c+4
29.	a2'	Sd2

White cannot flatten the wall at d2, which is in the way of the road
on rank 2, and which could free Black's reserves at c2, because the 4
black reserves exposed at e2 would run up file e and win the game.

30.	3c2+	3d+4'
31.	Sd4	e-4
32.	5e2+'	2c5-11
33.	e3+	4e-3
34.	3e4-111'	d+2
35.	e1+'	2c3-

White could have won with 36.  3e-2:12, if black did not respond in a
way which blocked the run.  Here, if White flattens the standing stone
at c2, ey must also leave a black stone at d2, which gives Black tak
and the win.

36.	2e2-'	d+3'
37.	3b2+12	2c-3:11'
38.	e2+'	d+3'
39.	3b4-	2d-3:11'

White has to defend against d4-, 4b+3:112, and 2e-3 so it would not
completely block Black if White added a white flat on any of c3, d3,
or e3.

40.	2e1+11	2d4-'

White has no walls handy, so is forced to throw eir capstone to make
any real difference.  White could have temporarily taken control of
the stack at b3 by moving b4-, but Black has more influence there, and
would have retaken the stack with another white captive.  Moving the
capstone could also allow White to run it back to c3, for better
influence more centrally located.  Black responds by shutting down
this option and establishing tak.

41.	4e3-22'	3d+3'

42. 2c4- would establish more influence over the stack on b3, but the
reply run of the stack 42. ... 3b+3:12 is a win for black.  So white
could either place a wall at d3, to interrupt the run, and lure the
black capstone off the white reserves at e3 (which Black can't do,
since it would give white tak and the game); or, interrupt the other
side of the road, so one run can't fix it.  White could either create
a wall Black won't think it's worth it to knock down, or get closer to
a road on rank 4 and reduce Black's flat count by one.

42.	a2+	3b3-12
43.	a4'	b5-'
44.	a+4	b3+'
45.	a+1	d3'

All of Black's roads revolve around b3, but trying to take it is the
road to Tinuë, since Black has enough pieces to just absorb White's
offenses:

	46.	2a+3	2b4-'
	47.	2c4-	3b+3'

	48. 3b1+12 doesn't work because 5c-3:14 is a win for Black,
	and white has no other play that matters.

Better for White to separate the road on file b from the road on rank 3,
so Black has to use road pieces from rank 3 to retake the white stack,
or use the wall and block eir own road.

46.	2c4-	2c2+

Black moves eir wall to get the two white captives out of the way, and
expose the two flats underneath, with 47. ... 3c3-, which brings the
wall back closer to block the white capstone.

47.	d2	3c3-'
48.	d2+	c+3'
49.	3b1+12	c4'
50.	3b3+	b5'
51.	4b4+'	b1
52.	a2'	c-4
53.	d5	2b4+"

In addition to 54.  ...  c4, Black threatens to win by 54. ... 5b+5:113.
54. 2a3+11 is not effective because it connects Black's road at a4
instead of a5.  Neither b3+, 2b2+11, nor 2e-4:11 touch rank 5, nor
keep Black from running the stack up rank 5 from b5.  A single wall
will not keep Black from winning.
