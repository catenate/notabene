Black could win with the run 4a+3:112, which creates a straight road

Since the carrying capacity is only 4, Black can no longer win with a
run up the files from a3, though 4a+3:22' would still threaten tak.

White can’t block with a flat at d1, since 17. d1 3a+1:111" completes
Black’s straight road from d1 to d4.

Black threatens tak with 17. … 3a+1:12.  White can’t respond by
moving eir wall at d1, since 15. d-1 d1" completes Black’s straight
road from d1 to d4.

White can’t respond with a flat at d2, because of the flat at c2; and
can’t move the wall at c1, because of the run from a1.

Black drives the game to completion by placing eir final (15th) stone.
Black easily wins on flat count (0–8), since white has been playing a
very reactive game to Black’s many tak threats (5–15), losing eir
early lead, and allowing Black to cover all the white flats not covered
by White’s own flats or walls.

winner: Black, by flat count

If there wasn’t a piece limit… 

White can’t run up rank a from a2 to cover a4 with eir wall, since
this leaves a black flat at a3, which then allows Black to play b3 to
complete the straight road from a3 to d3.

White can’t place a flat at b3, because 26. b3 4b4-" completes the
straight black road from a3 to d3; and also because 26. b3 a3+"
completes the straight black road from a4 to d4.

White can’t move the flat at a4, because 26. a4- a4" completes the
straight black road from a4 to d4.

So White has to block the road from a3 to d3 (but not with b3 or a4-),
while simultaneously preventing a3 from moving to a4.  The white wall
at a2 is the obvious choice for this mission, if it can be deployed
without creating a problem.  Since there are, or will be walls at d2
and a3, there is no concern about any black prisoners left at a2
immediately running to finish roads on the a file or rank 2.  All the
same, it is prudent to take as many prisoners with the wall as
possible, in an academic effort to keep down Black's flat count
(currently 1–9).
