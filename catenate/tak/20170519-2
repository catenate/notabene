6x6 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts.

1.	...	a6
2.	a1	f1
3.	b2	e2
4.	b4	e4
5.	b5	b3
6.	c3	c4
7.	c5	c6

To clean up the road against an inexperienced, capture-prone player:

	8.	c-3	c-4
	9.	2c3+	 b3
	10.	3b4-

8.	b6	a2
9.	b1'	c4-
10.	a3'	a2+
11.	b2+'	b2
12.	b1+'	a+6
13.	c6+	e3

Black plays at the cross of potential roads on the third rank and the
e file.

14.	2c-6'	2a+3
15.	a3	3b-3

Not much point to Black playing 4b3+13: it doesn't form more of a road
for Black, and could be immediately overrun by 4b6-13.

16.	a2	d3'
17.	a2+	b-3

White's move was forced, to avoid losing all 4 remaining pieces in his
rank-3 road to 18. 5a+3:1112!.

18.	b3'	2a+3'
19.	b4-	2c-3

Black is again forced, to avoid losing 3 flats to 4b+3:112, and chose
the option (between 4a+3 and 2c-3) which minimizes increase to the
size of the stack at b3.

20.	c3	3b+3'
21.	2b2+	4a+3
22.	Ca3!	5b3-

Black has taken so many prisoners that the introduction of the
capstone completely changes the nature of this game.

23.	a+3	4c3+

Faced with a difficult choice between which set of prisoners to sacrifice,
Black moves the group which could contribute more towards eir own road,
and possibly block a road run along the b file.

24.	3b3-	Cc2

A flat will not do, to block either of white's runs from b2, once White
moves off eir capstone and 3 black prisoners with 25.  4b2-'.  A black
capstone is necessary to prevent the white capstone from regaining
control of them.

25.	b2'	Sb4

Black can't use a flat at b4 because 26. b3+ or 5b2+14 is a win for white.
Because white must use a capstone alone to flatten a wall, white can't
flatten the standing stone at b4 without leaving black flats at b3, which
block white's road along the b file.  For white to work around a black
flat at b3, would require additional white flats at a2 and a3.

26.	a2	b4-

Black wants to reduce reach of white's capstone, and make using it
reveal a black-controlled stack.

27.	a3	b4
28.	a4'	a5
29.	a6'	b4+
30.	b4'	2b5+
31.	a6-'	a6
32.	2a5+'	a5
33.	3a6-'	a6
34.	Sb5	a6-
35.	b-5	4a6-13
36.	2a+5'	a6

White only has one piece left, but doesn't really want to play it at
this point, since eir flat could is down by 3.

37.	3b5-	e5
38.	4b+4'	Sb5

Black needs to stop the run 39. 2b4+11 to make sure there isn't
a road before ey places eir last piece.
	
39.	e6.

White just manages to make a tie in the flat count.

... but it isn't the last piece, each side had 9 more to play on a 6x6 board.
