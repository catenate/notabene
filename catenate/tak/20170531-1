6x6 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts by playing any piece.
First player strategy: play flats far for influence, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.
Second player strategy: play flats close for roads, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.

29. b3 won't work, since 3b2+ covers it and Black wins with a road on
the b file.  29. 2c-5 2a+5' isn't very effective, since Black re-establishes tak,
and White loses an active flat and a captive.  Not only does playing a
standing stone actually block Black from Tak for a while, it could
also be used to get back the 3 White captives at b2, or another 3
white captives at b1.  Black has an interest, however, in not allowing
such a piece swing.

White is setting up an inconvenient situation for Black's capstone:
Black could easily use the capstone to flatten White's standing stone
at b3, but then White would run the stack with 5b+2:212, creating a
road of 4 pieces.  To block this, Black puts a standing stone in its way.

Black could win with 5b1+32.

35.	Sb3	2d-6'

36. 2c5+ 4d-6' is not productive for Black, for the same reasons
stated earlier.  Again a new standing stone tries to recapture some
captives.

White can't control the captives at b1 with 48. 2d-1:11, because that would
give Black tak and the game.  White completely misses the tak threat,
too focused on building eir own road on the d file.

48.	d2'	3c3+111"!

If Black hadn't won, with a throw that flattened the white standing
stone at c6, ey could not have played eir last move, because 49. 3d4+12
would have won White the game.  White took too long to play 5c+6:14 to
take over the center of Black's road on rank 6.  Two perfect steps.

Winner: Black, by TinuÃ«.

Sum of squares: 4.
