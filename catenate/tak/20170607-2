8x8 me v me.

1.	2e5	a1	# switch colors for this move only

"You get a stack of two in the middle, I get a piece in a corner and
first move." Balance the first move against 2 stacked pieces with a
central position, and the flexibility to run in any direction, capture
an opposing piece, and still keep the current position, all at the
cost of an eventual move to perform the run, and the disadvantage of
possibly having two prisoners captured by a wall or capstone
(the first flat to threaten the stack isn't much of a problem, since
a run can just cover it).

2.	c2	e2
3.	f2	2e5-11

3. e3 would have been a better move for White, if Black hadn't had a
stack to run over it.  This is the reason why Black is given 2 flats
in a stack and a central location: a good run can turn the tables on
White's first-player advantage.

4.	e1	d2
5.	d1	d2-

Black would like to use d2 and build the e-file road before there d2
is captured, or there is too much white influence for eir moves to
provide advantage.

6.	d2	2d+1
7.	f1	d1

Black needs some influence at the edge to counter White's massing
attack, without using too many pieces from the road to repair itself.

8.	f-2	e3-

Black would like to keep White from capturing the stack ey created,
and using it to overrun eir road.

9.	d2-	e3

Black isn't worried about the attack on e1, because if White moves
first, then Black keeps the stack: 10. f-1 2e2-  11. 2d+1 e2-.
White will have to construct a stack with at least one reserve, or use
a standing stone or a capstone, to break the road "for good".

10.	Sf2	3e-2:12
11.	e2	3e-1

With the past two moves Black has been trying to limit White's
influence on eir pieces, build up a road from d1 to e4, and keep eir 5
white captives.  At this point, it's not really worth it to White to try to
reconnect eir road with a battle of flats, and Black has provided a
good opportunity to White to fork em.

12.	Sc1	5d1+14
13.	c1+	2d2-
14.	2c2+	Cd2

This seems to Black like a perfect opportunity to introduce one of eir
capstones: with a move to d3, to flatten White's standing stone now at
c3 (which could otherwise liberate three reserves with a run after the
move 2c+3); to block the run c+2 which sets up a white road and blocks
the black one; and to connect Black's own road from d1 to e4.

15.	2c+3	d2+

White's idea is to lure the black capstone up to d3, and then play eir
own capstone at d2, to block influence of Black's capstone, and the
two black flats in a stack at d1, on current squares of eir road.

16.	Cd2	7d3+412
17.	Sc5	d7
18.	c+4	2d6-11
19.	e5	6d4+42
20.	Sd4	5d+5
21.	Ce6	6e-5
22.	d4+	d6-

Many other goals can be accomplished under threat.  Here, White wants
to interrupt Black's road on the d and e files, and build up one of eir own.

23.	e5	8d-5:62
24.	Sc6	d4
25.	c6-	b+5
26.	c6	f4

White adds pieces to a road around the stack at c5, to try eventually
to liberate eir 6 captives, to keep Black's capstone engaged, and to
prevent Black from building much of a road.  Black is starting to
think about how to use a run or a throw of the stack at c5 to supply
two pieces of a road on ranks 4 and 5.

27.	f5	g4
28.	g5	h5
29.	h6	h4
30.	b6	a5'

Black makes the first tak threat, 30 moves into the game,
with 31. 2c-5".

31.	b-5	8c-5:62'
32.	b6-	3a+5'
33.	d6-	c4'
34.	2c2+11	4b+5

White missed a chance, somewhere along the line, to run eir capstone
up to eir rank-5 road with this stack.  That would probably have given the
2-black-stack at d1 enough useful mobility to make Black's rank-4 road
stronger.

35.	Sb6	4c-5

Now that Black has two stacks of white prisoners to defend,
threatening one with a standing stone forces Black to decide whether
to re-combine them into one large stack, or to move the stack away
from White's standing stone.  Moving the stack down the b file would
just expose it to 36. 2c-4, so Black might as well recombine the big
stack and sit on it.

36.	c5	Cb4

Black needs a capstone to complete eir road because there is too much
white influence along the c file, and the other capstone is
effectively pinned.

37.	2c+4	c4
38.	d3	a4
39.	c7	b+4
40.	c8'	c+4'

White threatened to win with 41. e1".  Black threatens to win with
41. … 3d-4:12", so placing a white flat at b4, or moving the white
flats at c3 or c5 onto c4, will not block it.  Placing a white standing
stone at b4 will also not block it, because Black can just move the
capstone at b5 down one rank, flattening it and completing the black
road on rank 4.

41.	f5-	3d+4:12'

White would like to lure away the black capstone at d4, to better
build up the road from e1 to c8.

42.	c5-	c5
43.	2d-5'	2e-4:11
44.	e6-	3f-4'
45.	g5-	h-4
46.	2e-5:11	3c-4
47.	c5-'	d-7

White's capstone neutralizes the ability of Black to control c4 with the
stacks at b4 and d4, and puts a strong block in Black's rank-4 road,
and threatens tak.  Better for Black to respond in a way which forces
White to use elements of the road to re-establish tak, but best for
Black to add another flat to the board (after move 47, the flat count
is 11-10).  Unfortunately, 47. … e1 leads to 48. f-1".  For White,
47. … d-7 is a bigger problem than d4-, since White can re-establish
tak with 48. c2' if eir road at and above c3 is not affected.

48.	c8-	c2
49.	2c7+'	c2+
50.	d-3	3b4-
51.	2c3-'	3b+3:12

White can most directly win with eir road on the c file.  If White
moves the capstone at c4, then Black can most directly win with a
straight road from a4 to h4, by h4 and 2d-4:11.  Otherwise, Black's
last move should be 5b5-14", to connect a4 and c3.

52.	b3	h4'
53.	b+3'	Sc1

Black threatens 2c1+11, which would swing the flat count from 11-10 to
9-11, and reduce the number of white squares on the c file from 7 to 5.

54.	d-2'	2d-3
55.	3c2+'	Sc2	

White moves the entire stack of 3 at c2 up to c3, to carry a white
flat directly under the capstone, so that ey can move the capstone
by itself to c1, to flatten the black standing stone.  So black adds
another standing stone to slow down White.

56.	7c+3:2131!	2d1+11

With one run to control 5 squares, White swings the flat count to
13-8, before Black's move adjusts it to 12-9.

57.	c+3	3d+3:12

At this point, Black would rather challenge White's stacks up the
third rank, and try to liberate some captives, than take the easy way
of building up influence down the third rank.

58.	g-3	3e4-

Black would like to block 59. 3f-3:12', which takes the stack at e3
for White.  By the same token, White is okay with 59. … 5e-3:23, 
since 60. 3f-3:12' covers the black flats Black exposed.

59.	d3	6e3+123

Black is trying to build up some influence, and maybe another road
(on file e, or e8 to g1), …

60.	e-2'	8b+5:44'!

or an opportunity to re-establish tak (61. … 5c-5"), and break up
the tallest stack, and bring eir capstone back into play, and block
White's tak.  White takes this opportunity to invite Black to add to
White's flat count, and try to recover eir 4 captives at c5.

61.	b6-	7c5+115!

White uses eir wall to block tak before Black flattens it with 3e-6:111.
Black takes an opportunity to swing the flat count from 9-9 to 6-11,
and move the white captives well out of the way.

62.	6f3+312	2g-4

White wants to rebalance the flat count, and interrupt Black's road,
and take advantage of Black exposing two white captives, building up
potential roads on file f and rank 6.

63.	2f6-11	c5

White takes captive a stack of mostly black, and Black places a key
piece at the intersection of roads c8-e1 and rank-5.

64.	3b5+111	b5'

White runs after eir prisoners, before Black takes the initiative to
block em.

65.	3f4+	Sf3

Black's idea is to claim to liberate eir reserves at f and threaten
tak, then be flattened by either 66. f5- 2f+5", or 66. 2d+4:11
2e4-11.  If White elects instead to liberate eir reserves at c8, and
then block Black's win (2f5-" reveals a Black road from a4 to h4),
then Black can run away with the reserves to h4: 66. b+8 f3+'
67. Sf3 5f+4:14.

This would be better if black first has a stone at g5.  The line of
play that starts with g5 doesn't end up much better, though, and gives
White the run up the 8th rank from c8.

	65.	3f4+	g5
	66.	b+8	2e-6:11
	67.	6c+8:11112 Sf3
	68.	4f5+22	f3+'
	69.	2d+4:11	2e-4:11

66.	b+8	f3+'
67.	2d+4:11	2e-6:11
68.	6c+8:11112!	2c7+

White's move 68 swung the flat count from 10-9 to 15-9.

69.	d-8	3c6+:21
70.	4f5+22	6c+8:132

White has been trying to build up roads in the past few moves,
but Black has been in a good position to shut em down.

71.	c6	g5
72.	g6'	2c7-
73.	b+6'	Sb6

White could have won with 74. 3c-6:12".  Instead, white takes the
opportunity to build out a road, and capture part of Black's most-
developed road.  Winning is often a useful forcing function, as one of
the tines of a fork, to specify the opponent's move, and take another
good move instead.

74.	3c6-12!	2e-4:11
75.	c7'	b+6
76.	d7'	2c+6
77.	e7'	a7
78.	a8'	a+7

78. a8' is stronger than 78. b-7' because although it gives Black
the freedom to move a7, it adds 1 to White's flat count, and creates
a fork in the winning road, which pushes up the road the location
Black needs to cover to block the road.

79.	b8'	b+7
80.	b7'	2c4+
81.	b+7'	d8-

Black would have liked to play to both d7, to avoid losing 2 flats to
82. 4c7-112, and allowing White to double the flats on another road
(from d1 to c8); and c6, to prevent White winning the game with
82. 3c-7:12".  Alas, not losing the game takes priority over a road,
and in eir move 82, White swings the flat count from 14-13 to 16-11.

82.	4c7-112!	5d-5

Black's response is to shut down the road-building by capturing 7
prisoners (the Chandrian?) under a capstone (an Amyr? Kvothe?).
At this point in the game there are no roads clearly near completion.

83.	Sd8	3f-8

White's idea was to liberate the 3 white captives at e8.

84.	2f-7:11	3d6-12
85.	3d-7:12'	4d4+112
86.	2b+7:11	g-5'
87.	3d7-12	b6

Black has been neglecting eir flat count (15-10), as they trade
some interesting road blocks.  White has a better board position,
14 unplayed pieces (so can end the game sooner with a flat win),
and 17 pieces captured by Black.  Black has focused most of eir
effort on ranks 4 and 5, 22 unplayed pieces, and 12 pieces captured
by white.

88.	b7	Sd7

White has the influence to recover if Black plays d4, whereas a Black
flat or standing stone at b7 would present much more of a challenge.
Black would like to lure away the white capstone from d5, or at least
pin it and get advantage elsewhere.

89.	a6'	b+6
90.	b6	d7-

Black sees that White would have liked to play 91. 2d-6' and then
92. d5+".  Playing 91. d5+' first and then 92. 2d-6" would work
as well, but White can't just flatten Black's standing stone, because
91. … g5" wins Black the game.

91.	Sg5	3d+6:12
92.	2f4+11	3f5-'

White and black both liberate some captives, and prepare to race down
the ranks with runs: White with 92. 5f-6:212', Black with 92. … 6f-4:1131".
So White has to block the fourth rank first.

93.	3d5-	6c+5'!

White has to block Black's win (e4", f5", or f4+"), in a way that
cannot immediately be re-established, before ey can run the white
capstone down rank 6.  Black would like to run 6f4+1131 after the
white capstone runs down rank 6, but eir nearness to tak, and
potential to change the board, drives White to take over the stack
at f4.

94.	3d+4:12	3c5-
95.	5f-6:212'	7e8-43

White can't play a flat or standing stone at f6 because White can move
eir capstone to cover that position.  White can't play 96. 8f-4:314,
leaving a black flat at f4, because 96. … g5" immediately wins the
game for Black.

96.	5f-4:14	5c-4:14

Black would be willing to trade the captives from c4 for two places
with a stack of 2 black pieces, if not that White will have enough
reserves to recapture each of those stacks.  At least Black can give
it up in a way that doesn't almost give White a win.

97.	4d-4:112	7e+6:214'
98.	3c6-	d4'
99.	7a+4:2113'!	5e-7:213

White wants to use the tak threat as a forced distraction, and
liberate the captives at e7.  Black would rather block the road with a
throw that moves the captives to where there are already a lot of
white flats.  The flat count for the hundredth move is 17-10.

100.	b6+'	d1
101.	4b7-112	Sc3

At this point, with a flat count of 19-8, and no nearly-complete road,
Black is just playing defense to spoil roads, and trying to liberate
some captives for a good run to turn things around.

102.	6b4+42	a+5
103.	2b6-	Sa5
104.	4c-5	Sc5
105.	b4	c5-
106.	e1	4c4+112
107.	c4'	5c-7:23
108.	d-1'	c+1

White planned 109. 7b5+34".

109.	5e-4	Se4

Black wants to block 7d+4:223 to build out a white road on rank 4.

110.	5d4-23	e6
111.	d-2	3d2+21

White's need to run the standing-stone blockade gives Black an
opportunity to build up a road from d1 to c8 (once White's road).

112.	c1'	2d-1

Black's move serves two purposes: it blocks White's tak threat, and it
leaves one flat at d1 to be part of the road ey builds.

113.	c2-	c7
114.	2c1+'	2d-4'

With two parallel roads, there's little chance of either being
completed, since each player can attack the other's road,
at the cost of pieces from eir own.  White conceives of a plan to
build up the stack at c4, and then run it up and over black's road on
file c.

115.	b+4	d4-

For white, b+4 is better than opening the road with c3+.  Black wants
to immediately respond to this threat, since White can right-away run
over three flats on Black's road.  For Black, d4- is better than 3d3-,
because ey could play the latter to restore the road if White left it alone.

116.	3c2+12	d-1

White could shift plans, to rebuild the road down from c4, since a lot
of pieces in only one quarter doesn't seem as useful as a nearly-
complete road across the board.  Or, since it's too easy to break up a
road as tenuous as the ones in the game so far, White tries the
approach of building up a quarter to see if that helps.  Or, ceding
territory in the game is never a good idea, and the best defense
against Black winning is for White to at least try to build a road,
and keep Black too busy to build one of eir own.  Also, going down
file c lets White liberate two captives at c1.

117.	6c4-123	b4

It doesn't help eir road as much as 117. … d4, but b4 is more
proactive and helps more to prevent and shut down White's road.

118.	a4	d4
119.	a+4'	d-4
120.	2c3+'	3d-3
121.	3c4-'	2d-3
122.	5c1+14'	d-2
123.	5c3-'	b+3
124.	c2+	8c+2

Black steps the stack at c2 away from any White influence.

125.	8c+3:1412'!	7d2+34'!

White's tak threat is new: a road from a6 to h3.  Black renews the
road threat from e6 to d4.

126.	c+4	e-4
127.	Sc4	g-4

Black's looking for a way to liberate some captives.  White can either
respond to that losing situation, or liberate some captives of eir own,
a kind of prisoner exchange.

128.	c+3	5f-4

Black wants to get the stack at f4 in position for a better run down
file e.  Again, White benefits more from exposing eir own reserves.

129.	4d-3:112'	5d4-113

Black plans 2d+1' to threaten to complete the road from d1 to c8.

130.	c+3'	d2+
131.	a2'	3d-1:111
132.	b2'	2c-1
133.	c1	4e4-112"!

Black can complete a road from e1 to c8 by playing c8".
Black can also complete a road from h6 to a3 by playing
5e-3:1112".

---

Play if both parties miss the tak threat by Black:

	134.	c-1'	2a+1

At this point White can place eir last unplayed piece, when the flat
count after the piece is played (currently 15-18) favors em to win.
The quickest way White can swing the flat count is to throw the
capstone at b5 to liberate the 4 captives at b1.  White can't throw
135. 8b5-1331 4b5+211" to allow black to complete the road from
b8 to d1.

	135.	7b5-1231

---

Play if both players miss the Black threat 5e-3:1112", which completes
the road from h6 to a3:

	134.	f-2	d1'
	135.	2e-2	e2'

---

So, White has to block, at once, both the roads e1 to c8 (c8") and
h6 to a3 (5e-3:1112"), which ey doesn't have enough influence over
the middle of the board to do.

Winner: Black, by Tinuë.
