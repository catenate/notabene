5x5 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts by playing any piece.
First player strategy: play flats far for influence, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.
Second player strategy: play flats close for roads, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.

This game starts with 5 available bombs (B) and 1 available assassin (A).

Bombs are activated by being dropped during a move or throw, in which
case they remove from the game both themselves, and the pieces above
and below them.  If a bomb is the only piece dropped on a square, then
only it and the piece below it, if any, is destroyed.  If the bomb and
another piece(s) is dropped, then the bomb, one piece below if
present, and one piece above it are destroyed.

1.	---	a5
2.	a1	e1

If this start shifts the first-player advantage to the second player,
perhaps allowing the first player's second piece to be a standing
stone or a capstone more finely balances the start?

3.	Cc3	Cd3
4.	c4	c5

Black starts placing pieces for a rank-5 road, and blocks the shortest
path of White's possible file-c road.  White in turn places a flat to
interrupt Black's plans.  Each player continues to build the road ey
have in mind.

5.	b5	d5
6.	c2	e5
7.	c1'	a+5'

One perfect step.

8.	a5	b4'

Why not 8.  ...  a4'?  Playing b4 allows Black to prevent White from
extending eir road on file c to b4, which would have more influence
over Black's attempt to finish the road in the a5 corner.  Playing b4
also starts to build a black road down the b file.

9.	a4	b3'
10.	a3'	b-3'

White can't play 11.  a+4' or c-4' to capture the black flat on b4,
because Black doesn't need this piece if ey throws 2a3+11" to
complete the road on the fifth rank.

11.	c4+'	d-5

Three perfect steps.

12.	c4	d5'
13.	a+5'	b4+'

White threatened to cover two pieces in Black's rank-5 road, and win
the game, with 14. 3b+5:12".  So even if the game is to continue,
Black wants to neutralize the threat of this run.  White, in turn,
is interested in neutralizing the threat of the throw up from a3,
but can't use a4- to do it now, because a5 is open for a black flat
and the win, which White can't use a4+ to block because of that
same throw.  14. c4+' 2b+5', then 15. Sa5, just wastes the flat at c4,
so it's better for white just to go immediately for the standing stone
to block.  The standing stone could also liberate the white captives
at b5, and take over several Black spaces with a run up rank 5.
Two perfect steps.

14.	Sa5	4b5-22'

White can't simply block with 15. a+5 because 15. ... 2c5-"
connects the 7-piece road from a3 to e5.  15. c4+' is superior
because it takes control of a reserve in the stack at c5, and
threatens tak with 16. 2c5-" (again, White this time), even if Black
places a flat with 15. ... c4' and re-establishes tak.

15.	c4+'	d-5

One perfect step.

16.	Sd5	d3+

There is a shift in the immediate goal by both players: from trying to
build a road, to trying to control the stack at c5.  White wants to limit
Black's options to run the stack at c5.  Black wants to flatten White's
second standing stone, block White from using eir reserves to win,
and get the black capstone closer to the black road, to help.

17.	c3+	d4+
18.	c4+'	Sc4

White wants to win with 19. 5c5-221", but Black blocks that with a
standing stone at c4.  White could flatten Black's standing stone,
but then Black would move eir capstone onto the stack at c5.

So far, sum of squares: 1⁲+3⁲+2⁲+1⁲ = 1+9+4+1 = 15.
