5x5 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts.

1.	...	a5
2.	a1	e1
3.	c3	e3

White plays for center influence, Black plays to create a road threat.

4.	d2	e2

White didn't block the middle of the road, so Black connects them into
an edge-crawl road of 3.

5.	e4	d4

Black generally develops the road, and separates the white flat
blocking the road from White's central flats.

6.	c4	d3'

White starts developing a central road, and Black presents the first tak.

7.	d5	e5'

White has many choices as to how to respond (which is a better
situation than Black is in, in a two-stone start where White plays first).
Effective moves, and Black's responses to create another tak, include
8.  c+4 e5-', 8.  d5- e5-', and 8.  e4- d+3'.  However, White playing
d+2 does the most to interrupt Black's road-building.

8.	d+2	d2

White could play d1 to block the road, but c2 creates enough influence
to block the road, and also develops eir own central road.

9.	c2	d1'
10.	d5-	e5-'

White blocks the d-file road and creates a 3-piece road on rank 4,
while Black again re-establishes tak.  Better for white to add to eir
flat count, than to capture.

11.	e5	d5'

Effective moves, and Black's responses to create another tak, include
12. e5- d5-', 12. c+3 e-3', and 12. 2e-2 e2'.  However, White playing c+2
does the most to interrupt Black's road-building, at the price of
shifting a white road of 3 to be two crossing white roads of 2, each.
If Black wants to re-establish a black road on the d or e files,
ey must capture a white-controlled stack and retake a prisoner.

12.	c+2 	c2
13.	b2	c+2'

Black elects to take the harder stack.  White could 2e-2, but c+3 is
more efficient at breaking up Black's road without creating a
placement opportunity on the road.

14.	c+3	3d2+12'!

This is the key move of the game: leave an open space to increase flat
count, capture two white stacks, and create a tak threat.  For White,
the chance to recapture prisoners, as well as (temporarily) block the
tak threat, is too useful to pass up.

15.	c+4	2d3+'

Black could have 2e-4', at the loss of one flat count, and eir compound
tak threat.  Black can't run the stack at d4 more than one space
without increasing White's flat count and giving up control of a space.
But, in the end, a move of one space is sufficient.

16.	d2	d1+'

White's move is forced, but ineffective at preventing Tinuë.

17.	e-5	3d4+"

Winner: Black, by Tinuë.

Sum of squares: 0.
