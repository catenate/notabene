5x5 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts by playing any piece.
First player strategy: play flats far for influence, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.
Second player strategy: play flats close for roads, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.

This game starts with 5 available bombs (B) and 1 available assassin (A).

Bombs are activated by being dropped during a move or throw, in which
case they remove from the game both themselves, and the pieces above
and below them.  If a bomb is the only piece dropped on a square, then
only it and the piece below it, if any, is destroyed.  If the bomb and
another piece(s) is dropped, then the bomb, one piece below if
present, and one piece above it are destroyed.

1.	---	a5
2.	a1	e1

If this start shifts the first-player advantage to the second player,
perhaps allowing the first player's second piece to be a standing
stone or a capstone more finely balances the start?

3.	Cc3	Cd3
4.	c4	c5

Black starts placing pieces for a rank-5 road, and blocks the shortest
path of White's possible file-c road.  White in turn places a flat to
interrupt Black's plans.  Each player continues to build the road ey
have in mind.

5.	b5	d5
6.	c2	e5
7.	c1'	a+5'

One perfect step.

8.	a5	b4'

Why not 8.  ...  a4'?  Playing b4 allows Black to prevent White from
extending eir road on file c to b4, which would have more influence
over Black's attempt to finish the road in the a5 corner.  Playing b4
also starts to build a black road down the b file.

9.	a4	b3'
10.	a3'	b-3'

White can't play 11.  a+4' or c-4' to capture the black flat on b4,
because Black doesn't need this piece if ey throws 2a3+11" to
complete the road on the fifth rank.

11.	c4+'	d-5

Three perfect steps.

12.	c4	d5'
13.	a+5'	b4+'

White threatened to cover two pieces in Black's rank-5 road, and win
the game, with 14. 3b+5:12".  So even if the game is to continue,
Black wants to neutralize the threat of this run.  White, in turn,
is interested in neutralizing the threat of the throw up from a3,
but can't use a4- to do it now, because a5 is open for a black flat
and the win, which White can't use a4+ to block because of that
same throw.  14. c4+' 2b+5', then 15. Sa5, just wastes the flat at c4,
so it's better for white just to go immediately for the standing stone
to block.  The standing stone could also liberate the white captives
at b5, and take over several Black spaces with a run up rank 5.
Two perfect steps.

14.	Sa5	4b5-22'

White can't simply block with 15. a+5 because 15. ... 2c5-"
connects the 7-piece road from a3 to e5.  15. c4+' is superior
because it takes control of a reserve in the stack at c5, and
threatens tak with 16. 2c5-" (again, White this time), even if Black
places a flat with 15. ... c4' and re-establishes tak.

15.	c4+'	d-5

One perfect step.

16.	Sd5	d3+

Black wants to position eir capstone to counter any attempt by White
to win with eir reserves in the stack at c5, and White wants to secure
the stack to cover Black's road on rank 5.

17.	d-5	d-4!

White gets the stack, but Black gets in the way of White's road on the
c file, threatens the stack, and prevents White's capstone from moving
to c4 to block the black road.

18. 	5c+5:14	d4'

Black is one move (b2) away from threatening tak with a road from c5
to b1, but that is an area with some white influence.

19.	2e5-	d3'
20.	e3	d2'
21.	2e-4	b2'

White creates the most substantial interruption that ey can, by using
a standing stone and inviting the Black capstone out of place, and by
freeing up a place for a white flat to build up a road down the e file.
This was enough to switch Black's focus to a more-easily-completed
road.

22.	b1	b2-'
23.	b2	a2'
24.	a1+	2b3-'

White's trying to use these defensive moves to build up a road along
the first and second ranks, which Black also tries to respond to in
eir choice of moves to re-establish tak, and distribution of influence.

25.	c2-	c+4

Black wants to be able to run to block the road created by either of
White's runs from c2.

26.	3c+2:12'	3d4-12
27.	d-5'	5d-2:113!

Ey didn't threaten tak, but Black's last two runs significantly influenced
the game, by swinging the flat count from 9-6 (White-Black) to 5-8,
and completely covering White's road on rank 2.  By placing a flat at d2,
Black threatens tak with both a rank-2 road, and a longer road from b1
to d5.  By moving the capstone down a rank, White can block both
roads, and recover enough (with a follow-up of 2c2+') to threaten tak.

28.	c3-	b3'
29.	b5	c4'
30.	3c2+12'	c2

One perfect step.

31.	c1+'	c1'
32.	d1'	d-3'

Black can't respond 32. ... d2' because then White would just move
33. d-1" for the win.  At this point the flat count is 7-10, with 6 white
flats remaining, and 4 black ones.  White needs to even out the flat
count if ey is not going to win with a road.  Black threatens tak with
both a road from a3 to e4, and another from b1 to d5.  Both roads use
the squares b3, c3, and d3, but both could use b4, c4, and d4, if
White moves the capstone to c3 and off the black captives at c4.
Three perfect steps.

33.	2c2+	d2'

What else does a move do?  Usually there are several choices, so choose
among them by seeing what other moves a particular move makes
possible.  White's move sets up 34. 3c+3', and then either 35. b5-"
to complete the road from a4 to e3, or 35. d2" to complete the road
from d1 to c5.  Or, in a pinch, a run down to c1 to block Black's road.

34.	4c3-13'	c3'

With only two black pieces left, the flat count is 8-10.  Black has an
incentive to just play them and end the game with a flat win.

35.	e-3'!	d2+'

White involves, with the c-file road, a piece (the flat at e3) that was
uninvolved; sets this piece up to complete the road (which also
reduces black's flat count); keeps from opening up the road with any
movement of its pieces; blocks both of Black's tak threats; and
reduces Black's flat count by 1.

Black's response is better than 35. ... d4-' because it keeps both
tak threats alive.

36.	3c4-'	c4'

White moves eir capstone to block the use of c3 in both roads, and
because a flat battle at c5 plays to eir strengths (a flat at b5, and
a throwable flat at e5).

37.	2c5-'	d-4'

Black threatens tak with both 37. ... c5", to complete the road from
b1 to c5, and 37. ... 3c+4:12", to complete the road from c3 to e4.
The flat count stands at 6-8, with 1 black flat unplayed.  White
should try (have tried) to set up a run to cover a few black flats, or
play flats in preference to moves.

38.	a+4'	2c-4'

White threatened tak with 39. 2b+4".  A much worse move would have
been 38. b5- 3c-4:12': no tak threat from White, and a loss of both
white flats at a4 and b4.  Ten perfect steps.

39.	4c-3	2c4-11'
40.	4c1+	5a+2:14'
41.	5b+3	b3'

Winner: Black by flat count (7-3).
