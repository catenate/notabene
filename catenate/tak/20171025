That is what I am saying, but the pieces need to be in play at the right
locations, so playing on the other side of the board might help you
build your road, but won't prevent your opponent from completing eirs.

To neutralize the first-player advantage you describe, I like to start
the game with something like the following setup on a 5x5 board, which
allows Black to block white's first road.

1.	2c3	a1	# playing opposite colors

White places two black flats in a stack in the middle of the board,
and Black places one white flat in the corner, and white has the first
move.  For the first road White builds from the starting corner,
whether a1-a5 or a1-e1, Black could play 2c-3:11 or 2c3-11 respectively,
to block it, and gain the tempo, one time during the game.
