5x5 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts by playing any piece.
First player strategy: limit first player's options by controlling the board through captures, walls, and the capstone.
Second player strategy: play flat, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.

White is so low on flats that eir focus shifts to liberating eir
reserves at b2.

Not the best move by black, since it gives white eir 3 reserves on a2,
but the intent was to not act pinned by the two walls at a2 and b2,
and to run the moved reserves up on rank 3.  Black, in general, would
have had a better time flattening white's walls if ey would have had a
flat of the same color under the capstone, to remain in control of the
white captives.

Black firmly locks down the large soft stack (black capstone, 2 black,
6 white), so building a roads on rank 4, finishing with the run 2a+4.
Black is looking to build a road on rank 3, finishing with a throw of
the capstone 2a+3.  Black would have preferred to have another flat
within the carry limit of the stack at a3, to avoid having to place a
flat at c3.

Black could also have 32. ... c3+, but that would have interrupted eir
own road-building, and would not have invited White to flatten a
standing stone and free two captives.  This would have allowed White a
quick response and renewed tak with 33. 3a+3:12', after which Black
could then have placed a standing stone, 33. ... Sa4, but that would
have left white with two flats on a road in file b.

33.	2b+3:11	d2

Black sets up a road from a3 to e(1|2), and works some mischief on
White's plans for a road along the d file.
