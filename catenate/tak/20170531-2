5x5 me v me. Proposed fixed start: White in one corner, Black in adjacent corners, White starts by playing any piece.
First player strategy: play flats far for influence, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.
Second player strategy: play flats close for roads, only take when forced, only add walls and capstone when forced.

This game starts with 5 bombs (a3, c1, c5, e3, e5) and 1 assassin (c3), to force them into play.

1.	---	a5
2.	a1	e1
3.	Cc2	d2

The capstone, and standing stones, are immune to the assassin,
since it cannot stack on them.  The capstone is immune to the bombs,
although the capstone and standing stones both set off the bombs.
The assassin is not immune to the bombs.

Bombs are set off by being dropped during a run or throw.  The bomb
removes from play itself, and the flat it lands on.  Can't move a bomb,
can only assume control of it by putting a piece on top of it.

7.	b-3'	a+5

White has no influence close enough to Black's road to stop it.

Winner: Black, by TinuÃ«.
