lintsh is a Bourne shell that optionally warns about suspicious or
nonportable constructs.  It is intended to help script authors write
correct, portable scripts; it will also be suitable for use as /bin/sh.
It does not exist yet, and it might never, or perhaps the warning
functionality could be added to an existing shell.  Regardless,
this list of gotchas will be maintained, and you can get into the habit
of coding to avoid them.
