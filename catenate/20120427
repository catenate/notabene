To get around this problem with my own documents and data, I only
encode them in UTF-8 text files, or in LaTeX documents, and store them
in an internet file-distribution service.

UTF-8 is a subset of Unicode (the project to encode all the world's
alphabets) which is compatible with ASCII (the standard of
representing Latin-alphabet text and Arabic numerals on teleprinters,
terminals, and in computer filesystems since the 1960s).  UTF-8 is a
published standard understood by modern programming languages and web
browsers, and likely to be understood as well as ASCII by future
languages and browsers.

LaTeX is a high-quality technical document-preparation markup language
used extensively by academics.  It was written by Donald Knuth, an
extremely influential computer scientist, and is free software
maintained by the open-source programming community.

I store my files in directories not only on my own computer, but also
in directories stored in the internet, and replicated to my other
computers, through the DropBox service.  If DropBox should cease
business, I still have the copies on my machines.

So there's no single point of failure that can delete my most
important files; they are encoded in formats free from vendor lock-in;
and in formats that the widest possible variety of programs (from
command-line utilites, to email and word processors, to web browsers)
can understand and manipulate.
