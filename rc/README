These will work in the rc shell provided by Plan 9 and plan9port.
They will also work in Byron Rakitzis's port of rc to *nix.

nb works slightly differently here than it does in sh-inferno.  When run
without any arguments, it will regenerate indices for all of the
indexes listed in 'nbindexes', rather than just the current directory.
This allows it be run in a cronjob, periodically updating one's nb
archives in the background.

The version of kanban provided here has a few extra identifiers that it
searches for.  It will search for nb lines tagged with '_ref', '_fig', and
'_footnote', which are useful when writing reports and research articles.

You may need to change the shebang line (the top line of each script
that starts with #!) for your system.
