The tool nb searches for the given keyword in its indexes,
then indexes lines starting with nb or #nb in files in the
current directory (nbindex), and adds the current directory
to a list of known indexes (nbindexes).

The filter nbdoc expands file:line references, in nb output,
to the full text of the indexed note.

The filter so counts keywords in nb output, and orders them
by frequency.

The tool kanban lists index lines which match a set of
specific _keywords, modelled after a kanban process.

This project also includes an extensive example:
my public notebook.
